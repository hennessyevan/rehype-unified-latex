    <h2 class="nobreak">TWO STONES IN A SQUARE</h2>
  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had for the first time crossed St
    George’s Channel, and for the first time stepped
    out of a Dublin hotel on to St Stephen’s Green,
    the first of all my impressions was that of a
    particular statue, or rather portion of a statue.
    I left many traditional mysteries already in my
    track, but they did not trouble me as did this
    random glimpse or vision. I have never understood
    why the Channel is called St George’s
    Channel; it would seem more natural to call it
    St Patrick’s Channel since the great missionary
    did almost certainly cross that unquiet sea and
    look up at those mysterious mountains. And
    though I should be enchanted, in an abstract
    artistic sense, to imagine St George sailing
    towards the sunset, flying the silver and scarlet
    colours of his cross, I cannot in fact regard that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
    journey as the most fortunate of the adventures
    of that flag. Nor, for that matter, do I know
    why the Green should be called St Stephen’s
    Green, nor why the parliamentary enclosure at
    Westminster is also connected with the first
    of the martyrs; unless it be because St Stephen
    was killed with stones. The stones, piled
    together to make modern political buildings,
    might perhaps be regarded as a cairn, or heap
    of missiles, marking the place of the murder of
    a witness to the truth. And while it seems
    unlikely that St Stephen was pelted with
    statues as well as stones, there are undoubtedly
    statues that might well kill a Christian at sight.
    Among these graven stones, from which the
    saints suffer, I should certainly include some of
    those figures in frock coats standing opposite
    St Stephen’s Westminster. There are many
    such statues in Dublin also; but the one with
    which I am concerned was at first partially
    veiled from me. And the veil was at least as
    symbolic as the vision.</p>
  <p>I saw what seemed the crooked hind legs of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
    horse on a pedestal and deduced an equestrian
    statue, in the somewhat bloated fashion of the
    early eighteenth century equestrian statues.
    But the figure, from where I stood, was wholly
    hidden in the tops of trees growing round it in
    a ring; masking it with leafy curtains or draping
    it with leafy banners. But they were green
    banners, that waved and glittered all about it
    in the sunlight; and the face they hid was the
    face of an English king. Or rather, to speak
    more correctly, a German king.</p>
  <p>When laws can stay ... it was impossible
    that an old rhyme should not run in my head,
    and words that appealed to the everlasting
    revolt of the green things of the earth....
    ‘And when the leaves in summer time their
    colour dare not show.’ The rhyme seemed to
    reach me out of remote times and find arresting
    fulfilment, like a prophecy; it was impossible
    not to feel that I had seen an omen. I was
    conscious vaguely of a vision of green garlands
    hung on gray stone; and the wreaths were
    living and growing, and the stone was dead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
    Something in the simple substances and elemental
    colours, in the white sunlight, and the
    sombre and even secret image held the mind
    for a moment in the midst of all the moving
    city, like a sign given in a dream. I was told
    that the figure was that of one of the first
    Georges; but indeed I seemed to know already
    that it was the White Horse of Hanover that
    had thus grown gray with Irish weather or
    green with Irish foliage. I knew only too well,
    already, that the George who had really crossed
    the Channel was not the saint. This was one
    of those German princes whom the English
    aristocracy used when it made the English
    domestic polity aristocratic and the English
    foreign policy German. Those Englishmen
    who think the Irish are pro-German, or those
    Irishmen who think the Irish ought to be pro-German,
    would presumably expect the Dublin
    populace to have hung the statue of this
    German deliverer with national flowers and
    nationalist flags. For some reason, however,
    I found no traces of Irish tributes round the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
    pedestal of the Teutonic horsemen. I wondered
    how many people in the last fifty years
    have ever cared about it, or even been conscious
    of their own carelessness. I wonder how many
    have ever troubled to look at it, or even troubled
    not to look at it. If it fell down, I wonder
    whether anybody would put it up again. I do
    not know; I only know that Irish gardeners,
    or some such Irish humorists, had planted trees
    in a ring round that prancing equestrian
    figure; trees that had, so to speak, sprung up
    and choked him, making him more unrecognisable
    than a Jack-in-the-Green. Jack or George
    had vanished; but the Green remained.</p>
  <p>About a stone’s-throw from this calamity in
    stone there stood, at the corner of a gorgeously
    coloured flower-walk, a bust evidently by a
    modern sculptor, with modern symbolic ornament
    surmounted by the fine falcon face of the
    poet Mangan, who dreamed and drank and
    died, a thoughtless and thriftless outcast, in
    the darkest of the Dublin streets around that
    place. This individual Irishman really was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
    what we were told that all Irishmen were, hopeless,
    heedless, irresponsible, impossible, a
    tragedy of failure. And yet it seemed to be his
    head that was lifted and not hidden; the gay
    flowers only showed up this graven image as
    the green leaves shut out the other; everything
    around him seemed bright and busy, and told
    rather of a new time. It was clear that modern
    men did stop to look at <i>him</i>; indeed modern
    men had stayed there long enough to make
    him a monument. It was almost certain that
    if his monument fell down it really would
    be put up again. I think it very likely there
    would be competition among advanced modern
    artistic schools of admitted crankiness and
    unimpeachable lunacy; that somebody would
    want to cut out a Cubist Mangan in a style less
    of stone than of bricks; or to set up a Vorticist
    Mangan, like a frozen whirlpool, to terrify the
    children playing in that flowery lane. For
    when I afterwards went into the Dublin Art
    Club, or mixed generally in the stimulating
    society of the intellectuals of the Irish capital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
    I found a multitude of things which moved
    both my admiration and amusement. Perhaps
    the best thing of all was that it was the one
    society that I have seen where the intellectuals
    were intellectual. But nothing pleased me more
    than the fact that even Irish art was taken with
    a certain Irish pugnacity; as if there could be
    street fights about æsthetics as there once were
    about theology. I could almost imagine an
    appeal for pikes to settle a point about art
    needlework, or a suggestion of dying on the
    barricades for a difference about bookbinding.
    And I could still more easily imagine a sort of
    ultra-civilised civil war round the half-restored
    bust of poor Mangan. But it was in a yet
    plainer and more popular sense that I felt that
    bust to be the sign of a new world, where the
    statue of Royal George was only the ruin of an
    old one. And though I have since seen many
    much more complex, and many decidedly
    contradictory things in Ireland, the allegory of
    those two stone images in that public garden
    has remained in my memory, and has not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
    reversed. The Glorious Revolution, the great
    Protestant Deliverer, the Hanoverian Succession,
    these things were the very pageant and
    apotheosis of success. The Whig aristocrat
    was not merely victorious; it was as a victor
    that he asked for victory. The thing was fully
    expressed in all the florid and insolent statuary
    of the period, in all those tumid horsemen in
    Roman uniform and rococo periwigs shown
    as prancing in perpetual motion down shouting
    streets to their triumphs; only to-day the
    streets are empty and silent, and the horse
    stands still. Of such a kind was the imperial
    figure round which the ring of trees had risen,
    like great green fans to soothe a sultan or great
    green curtains to guard him. But it was in a
    sort of mockery that his pavilion was thus
    painted with the colour of his conquered
    enemies. For the king was dead behind his
    curtains, his voice will be heard no more, and
    no man will even wish to hear it, while the
    world endures. The dynastic eighteenth century
    is dead if anything is dead; and these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
    idols at least are only stones. But only a few
    yards away, the stone that the builders rejected
    is really the head of a corner, standing at the
    corner of a new pathway, coloured and crowded
    with children and with flowers.</p>
  <p>That, I suspect, is the paradox of Ireland in
    the modern world. Everything that was
    thought progressive as a prancing horse has
    come to a standstill. Everything that was
    thought decadent as a dying drunkard has
    risen from the dead. All that seemed to have
    reached a <i>cul de sac</i> has turned the corner, and
    stands at the opening of a new road. All that
    thought itself on a pedestal has found itself up
    a tree. And that is why those two chance stones
    seem to me to stand like graven images on either
    side of the gateway by which a man enters
    Ireland. And yet I had not left the same small
    enclosure till I had seen one other sight which
    was even more symbolic than the flowers near
    the foot of the poet’s pedestal. A few yards
    beyond the Mangan bust was a model plot of
    vegetables, like a kitchen garden with no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
    kitchen or house attached to it, planted out in
    a patchwork of potatoes, cabbages, and turnips,
    to prove how much could be done with an acre.
    And I realised as in a vision that all over the
    new Ireland that patch is repeated like a pattern;
    and where there is a real kitchen garden there
    is also a real kitchen; and it is not a communal
    kitchen. It is more typical even than the poet
    and the flowers; for these flowers are also food,
    and this poetry is also property; property
    which, when properly distributed, is the poetry
    of the average man. It was only afterwards
    that I could realise all the realities to which this
    accident corresponded; but even this little
    public experiment, at the first glance, had something
    of the meaning of a public monument.
    It was this which the earth itself had reared
    against the monstrous image of the German
    monarch; and I might have called this chapter
    Cabbages and Kings.</p>
  <p>My life is passed in making bad jokes and
    seeing them turn into true prophecies. In the
    little town in South Bucks, where I live, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
    remember some talk of appropriate ceremonies
    in connection with the work of sending vegetables
    to the Fleet. There was a suggestion
    that some proceedings should end with ‘God
    Save the King,’ an amendment by some one
    (of a more naval turn of mind) to substitute
    ‘Rule Britannia’; and the opposition of one
    individual, claiming to be of Irish extraction,
    who loudly refused to lend a voice to either.
    Whatever I retain, in such rural scenes, of the
    frivolity of Fleet Street led me to suggest that
    we could all join in singing ‘The Wearing of
    the Greens.’ But I have since discovered that
    this remark, like other typical utterances of the
    village idiot, was in truth inspired; and was a
    revelation and a vision from across the sea,
    a vision of what was really being done, not by
    the village idiots but by the village wise men.
    For the whole miracle of modern Ireland might
    well be summed up in the simple change from
    the word ‘green’ to the word ‘greens.’ Nor
    would it be true to say that the first is poetical
    and the second practical. For a green tree is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
    quite as poetical as a green flag; and no one in
    touch with history doubts that the waving of
    the green flag has been very useful to the growing
    of the green tree. But I shall have to touch
    upon all such controversial topics later, for
    those to whom such statements are still controversial.
    Here I would only begin by recording
    a first impression as vividly coloured and
    patchy as a modernist picture; a square of
    green things growing where they are least
    expected; the new vision of Ireland. The discovery,
    for most Englishmen, will be like
    touching the trees of a faded tapestry, and
    finding the forest alive and full of birds. It
    will be as if, on some dry urn or dreary column,
    figures which had already begun to crumble
    magically began to move and dance. For
    culture as well as mere caddishness assumed
    the decay of these Celtic or Catholic things;
    there were artists sketching the ruins as well as
    trippers picnicking in them; and it was not the
    only evidence that a final silence had fallen on
    the harp of Tara, that it did not play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
    ‘Tararaboomdeay.’ Englishmen believed in
    Irish decay even when they were large-minded
    enough to lament it. It might be said that
    those who were most penitent because the thing
    was murdered, were most convinced that it was
    killed. The meaning of these green and solid
    things before me is that it is not a ghost that
    has risen from the grave. A flower, like a flag,
    might be little more than a ghost; but a fruit
    has that sacramental solidity which in all
    mythologies belongs not to a ghost, but to a
    god. This sight of things sustaining, and a
    beauty that nourishes and does not merely
    charm, was a premonition of practicality in the
    miracle of modern Ireland. It is a miracle more
    marvellous than the resurrection of the dead.
    It is the resurrection of the body.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> only excuse of literature is to make things
    new; and the chief misfortune of journalism is
    that it has to make them old. What is hurried
    has to be hackneyed. Suppose a man has to
    write on a particular subject, let us say America;
    if he has a day to do it in, it is possible that, in
    the last afterglow of sunset, he may have discovered
    at least one thing which he himself
    really thinks about America. It is conceivable
    that somewhere under the evening star he may
    have a new idea, even about the new world. If
    he has only half an hour in which to write, he
    will just have time to consult an encyclopædia
    and vaguely remember the latest leading articles.
    The encyclopædia will be only about a decade
    out of date; the leading articles will be æons out
    of date—having been written under similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
    conditions of modern rush. If he has only a
    quarter of an hour in which to write about
    America, he may be driven in mere delirium and
    madness to call her his Gigantic Daughter in
    the West, to talk of the feasibility of Hands
    Across the Sea, or even to call himself an Anglo-Saxon,
    when he might as well call himself a
    Jute. But whatever debasing banality be the
    effect of business scurry in criticism, it is but one
    example of a truth that can be tested in twenty
    fields of experience. If a man must get to
    Brighton as quickly as possible, he can get
    there quickest by travelling on rigid rails on a
    recognised route. If he has time and money
    for motoring, he will still use public roads;
    but he will be surprised to find how many
    public roads look as new and quiet as private
    roads. If he has time enough to walk, he may
    find for himself a string of fresh footpaths, each
    one a fairy-tale. This law of the leisure needed
    for the awakening of wonder applies, indeed,
    to things superficially familiar as well as to
    things superficially fresh. The chief case for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
    old enclosures and boundaries is that they
    enclose a space in which new things can always
    be found later, like live fish within the four
    corners of a net. The chief charm of having
    a home that is secure is having leisure to feel
    it as strange.</p>
  <p>I have often done the little I could to correct
    the stale trick of taking things for granted:
    all the more because it is not even taking them
    for granted. It is taking them without gratitude;
    that is, emphatically as not granted.
    Even one’s own front door, released by one’s
    own latchkey, should not only open inward on
    things familiar, but outward on things unknown.
    Even one’s own domestic fireside should be
    wild as well as domesticated; for nothing could
    be wilder than fire. But if this light of the
    higher ignorance should shine even on familiar
    places, it should naturally shine most clearly
    on the roads of a strange land. It would be well
    if a man could enter Ireland really knowing
    that he knows nothing about Ireland; if
    possible, not even the name of Ireland. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
    misfortune is that most men know the name
    too well, and the thing too little. This book
    would probably be a better book, as well as a
    better joke, if I were to call the island throughout
    by some name like Atlantis, and only
    reveal on the last page that I was referring to
    Ireland. Englishmen would see a situation of
    great interest, objects with which they could
    feel considerable sympathy, and opportunities
    of which they might take considerable advantage,
    if only they would really look at the place
    plain and straight, as they would at some
    entirely new island, with an entirely new name,
    discovered by that seafaring adventure which
    is the real romance of England. In short, the
    Englishman might do something with it, if he
    would only treat it as an object in front of him,
    and not as a subject or story left behind him.
    There will be occasion later to say all that
    should be said of the need of studying the
    Irish story. But the Irish story is one thing
    and what is called the Irish Question quite
    another; and in a purely practical sense the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
    best thing the stranger can do is to forget the
    Irish Question and look at the Irish. If he
    looked at them simply and steadily, as he
    would look at the natives of an entirely new
    nation with a new name, he would become
    conscious of a very strange but entirely solid
    fact. He would become conscious of it, as a
    man in a fairy tale might become conscious
    that he had crossed the border of fairyland,
    by such a trifle as a talking cow or a haystack
    walking about on legs.</p>
  <p>For the Irish Question has never been discussed
    in England. Men have discussed Home
    Rule; but those who advocated it most warmly,
    and as I think wisely, did not even know what
    the Irish meant by Home. Men have talked
    about Unionism; but they have never even
    dared to propose Union. A Unionist ought
    to mean a man who is not even conscious of the
    boundary of the two countries; who can walk
    across the frontier of fairyland, and not even
    notice the walking haystack. As a fact, the
    Unionist always shoots at the haystack; though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
    he never hits it. But the limitation is not
    limited to Unionists; as I have already said,
    the English Radicals have been quite as incapable
    of going to the root of the matter.
    Half the case for Home Rule was that Ireland
    could not be trusted to the English Home
    Rulers. They also, to recur to the parable,
    have been unable to take the talking cow by
    the horns; for I need hardly say that the talking
    cow is an Irish bull. What has been the matter
    with their Irish politics was simply that they
    were English politics. They discussed the
    Irish Question; but they never seriously
    contemplated the Irish Answer. That is, the
    Liberal was content with the negative truth,
    that the Irish should not be prevented from
    having the sort of law they liked. But the
    Liberal seldom faced the positive truth, about
    what sort of law they would like. He instinctively
    avoided the very imagination of this; for
    the simple reason that the law the Irish would
    like is as remote from what is called Liberal as
    from what is called Unionist. Nor has the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
    Liberal ever embraced it in his broadest liberality,
    nor the Unionist ever absorbed it into his
    most complete unification. It remains outside
    us altogether, a thing to be stared at like a fairy
    cow; and by far the wisest English visitor is
    he who will simply stare at it. Sooner or later
    he will see what it means; which is simply
    this: that whether it be a case for coercion or
    emancipation (and it might be used either way)
    the fact is that a free Ireland would not only
    <i>not</i> be what we call lawless, but might not even
    be what we call free. So far from being an
    anarchy, it would be an orderly and even
    conservative civilisation—like the Chinese.
    But it would be a civilisation so fundamentally
    different from our own, that our own Liberals
    would differ from it as much as our own
    Conservatives. The fair question for an Englishman
    is whether that fundamental difference
    would make division dangerous; it has already
    made union impossible. Now in turning over
    these notes of so brief a visit, suffering from all
    the stale scurry of my journalistic trade, I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
    been in doubt between a chronological and a
    logical order of events. But I have decided in
    favour of logic, of the high light that really
    revealed the picture, and by which I firmly
    believe that everything else should be seen.
    And if any one were to ask me what was the
    sight that struck me most in Ireland, both as
    strange and as significant, I should know what
    to reply. I saw it long after I had seen the
    Irish cities, had felt something of the brilliant
    bitterness of Dublin and the stagnant optimism
    of Belfast; but I put it first here because I am
    certain that without it all the rest is meaningless;
    that it lies behind all politics, enormous
    and silent, as the great hills lie beyond Dublin.
  </p>
  <p>I was moving in a hired motor down a road
    in the North-West, towards the middle of that
    rainy autumn. I was not moving very fast;
    because the progress was slowed down to a
    solemn procession by crowds of families with
    their cattle and live stock going to the market
    beyond; which things also are an allegory.
    But what struck my mind and stuck in it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
    this; that all down one side of the road, as far
    as we went, the harvest was gathered in neatly
    and safely; and all down the other side of the
    road it was rotting in the rain. Now the side
    where it was safe was a string of small plots
    worked by peasant proprietors, as petty by our
    standards as a row of the cheapest villas. The
    land on which all the harvest was wasted was
    the land of a large modern estate. I asked why
    the landlord was later with his harvesting than
    the peasants; and I was told rather vaguely
    that there had been strikes and similar labour
    troubles. I did not go into the rights of the
    matter; but the point here is that, whatever
    they were, the moral is the same. You may
    curse the cruel Capitalist landlord or you may
    rave at the ruffianly Bolshevist strikers; but
    you must admit that between them they had
    produced a stoppage, which the peasant proprietorship
    a few yards off did not produce.
    You might support either where they conflicted,
    but you could not deny the sense in which they
    had combined, and combined to prevent what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
    a few rustics across the road could combine to
    produce. For all that we in England agree
    about and disagree about, all for which we
    fight and all from which we differ, our darkness
    and our light, our heaven and hell, were there
    on the left side of the road. On the right side
    of the road lay something so different that we
    do not even differ from it. It may be that
    Trusts are rising like towers of gold and iron,
    overshadowing the earth and shutting out the
    sun; but they are only rising on the left side
    of the road. It may be that Trade Unions are
    laying labyrinths of international insurrection,
    cellars stored with the dynamite of a merely
    destructive democracy; but all that international
    maze lies to the left side of the road.
    Employment and unemployment are there;
    Marx and the Manchester School are there.
    The left side of the road may even go through
    amazing transformations of its own; its story
    may stride across abysses of anarchy; but it
    will never step across the road. The landlord’s
    estate may become a sort of Morris Utopia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
    organised communally by Socialists, or more
    probably by Guild Socialists. It may (as I fear
    is much more likely) pass through the stage of
    an employer’s model village to the condition of
    an old pagan slave-estate. But the peasants
    across the road would not only refuse the
    Servile State, but would quite as resolutely
    refuse the Utopia. Europe may seem to be
    torn from end to end by the blast of a Bolshevist
    trumpet, sundering the bourgeois from the
    proletarian; but the peasant across the road is
    neither a bourgeois nor a proletarian. England
    may seem to be rent by an irreconcilable rivalry
    between Capital and Labour; but the peasant
    across the road is both a capitalist and a labourer.
    He is several other curious things; including
    the man who got his crops in first; who was
    literally first in the field.</p>
  <p>To an Englishman, especially a Londoner,
    this was like walking to the corner of a London
    street and finding the policeman in rags, with
    a patch on his trousers and a smudge on his
    face; but the crossing-sweeper wearing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
    single eyeglass and a suit fresh from a West
    End tailor. In fact, it was nearly as surprising
    as a walking haystack or a talking cow. What
    was generally dingy, dilatory, and down-at-heels
    was here comparatively tidy and timely;
    what was orderly and organised was belated
    and abandoned. For it must be sharply
    realised that the peasant proprietors succeeded
    here, not only because they were really proprietors,
    but because they were only peasants.
    It was <i>because</i> they were on a small scale that
    they were a great success. It was because they
    were too poor to have servants that they grew
    rich in spite of strikers. It was, so far as it
    went, the flattest possible contradiction to all
    that is said in England, both by Collectivists
    and Capitalists, about the efficiency of the great
    organisation. For in so far as it had failed, it
    had actually failed, not only through being
    great, but through being organised. On the
    left side of the road the big machine had stopped
    working, <i>because</i> it was a big machine. The
    small men were still working, because they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
    were not machines. Such were the strange
    relations of the two things, that the stars in
    their courses fought against Capitalism; that
    the very clouds rolling over that rocky valley
    warred for its pigmies against its giants. The
    rain falls alike on the just and the unjust; yet
    here it had not fallen alike on the rich and poor.
    It had fallen to the destruction of the rich.</p>
  <p>Now I do, as a point of personal opinion,
    believe that the right side of the road was
    really the right side of the road. That is, I
    believe it represented the right side of the
    question; that these little pottering peasants
    had got hold of the true secret, which is missed
    both by Capitalism and Collectivism. But I
    am not here urging my own preferences on my
    own countrymen; and I am not concerned
    primarily to point out that this is an argument
    against Capitalism and Collectivism. What I
    do point out is that it is the fundamental argument
    against Unionism. Perhaps it is, on that
    ultimate level, the only argument against
    Unionism; which is probably why it is never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
    used against Unionists. I mean, of course,
    that it was never really used against English
    Unionists by English Home Rulers, in the
    recriminations of that Irish Question which
    was really an English Question. The essential
    demanded of that question was merely that it
    should be an open question; a thing rather like
    an open wound. Modern industrial society is
    fond of problems, and therefore not at all fond
    of solutions. A consideration of those who
    really have understood this fundamental fact
    will be sufficient to show how confusing and
    useless are the mere party labels in the matter.
    George Wyndham was a Unionist who was
    deposed because he was a Home Ruler. Sir
    Horace Plunkett is a Unionist who is trusted
    because he is a Home Ruler. By far the most
    revolutionary piece of Nationalism that was
    ever really effected for Ireland was effected by
    Wyndham, who was an English Tory squire.
    And by far the most brutal and brainless piece
    of Unionism that was ever imposed on Ireland
    was imposed in the name of the Radical theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
    of Free Trade, when the Irish juries brought in
    verdicts of wilful murder against Lord John
    Russell. I say this to show that my sense of
    a reality is quite apart from the personal accident
    that I have myself always been a Radical
    in English politics, as well as a Home Ruler in
    Irish politics. But I say it even more in order
    to re-affirm that the English have first to forget
    all their old formulæ and look at a new fact.
    It is not a new fact; but it is new to them.</p>
  <p>To realise it we must not only go outside
    the British parties but outside the British
    Empire, outside the very universe of the ordinary
    Briton. The real question can be easily
    stated, for it is as simple as it is large. What is
    going to happen to the peasantries of Europe,
    or for that matter of the whole world? It
    would be far better, as I have already suggested,
    if we could consider it as a new case of some
    peasantry in Europe, or somewhere else in the
    world. It would be far better if we ceased to
    talk of Ireland and Scotland, and began to talk
    of Ireland and Serbia. Let us, for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
    our own mental composure, call this unfortunate
    people Slovenes. But let us realise that
    these remote Slovenes are, by the testimony of
    every truthful traveller, rooted in the habit of
    private property, and now ripening into a
    considerable private prosperity. It will often
    be necessary to remember that the Slovenes are
    Roman Catholics; and that, with that impatient
    pugnacity which marks the Slovene
    temperament, they have often employed
    violence, but always for the restoration of what
    they regarded as a reasonable system of private
    property. Now in a hundred determining
    districts, of which France is the most famous,
    this system has prospered. It has its own faults
    as well as its own merits; but it has prospered.
    What is going to happen to it? I will here
    confine myself to saying with the most solid
    confidence what is not going to happen to it.
    It is not going to be <i>really</i> ruled by Socialists;
    and it is not going to be really ruled by merchant
    princes, like those who ruled Venice or like
    those who rule England.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>It is not merely that England ought not to
    rule Ireland but that England cannot. It is not
    merely that Englishmen cannot rule Irishmen,
    but that merchants cannot rule peasants.
    It is not so much that we have dealt benefits
    to England and blows to Ireland. It is
    that our benefits for England would be blows
    to Ireland. And this we already began to admit
    in practice, before we had even dimly begun to
    conceive it in theory. We do not merely admit
    it in special laws against Ireland like the
    Coercion Acts, or special laws in favour of
    Ireland like the Land Acts; it is admitted even
    more by specially exempting Ireland than by
    specially studying Ireland. In other words,
    whatever else the Unionists want, they do not
    want to unite; they are not quite so mad as
    that. I cannot myself conceive any purpose
    in having one parliament except to pass one
    law; and one law for England and Ireland is
    simply something that becomes more insanely
    impossible every day. If the two societies were
    stationary, they would be sufficiently separate;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
    but they are both moving rapidly in opposite
    directions. England may be moving towards
    a condition which some call Socialism and I
    call Slavery; but whatever it is, Ireland is
    speeding farther and farther from it. Whatever
    it is, the men who manage it will no more
    be able to manage a European peasantry than
    the peasants in these mud cabins could manage
    the Stock Exchange. All attempts, whether
    imperial or international, to lump these peasants
    along with some large and shapeless thing called
    Labour, are part of a cosmopolitan illusion
    which sees mankind as a map. The world of
    the International is a pill, as round and as
    small. It is true that all men want health; but
    it is certainly not true that all men want the
    same medicine. Let us allow the cosmopolitan
    to survey the world from China to Peru; but
    do not let us allow the chemist to identify
    Chinese opium and Peruvian bark.</p>
  <p>My parallel about the Slovenes was only a
    fancy; yet I can give a real parallel from the
    Slavs which is a fact. It was a fact from my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
    own experience in Ireland; and it exactly
    illustrates the real international sympathies of
    peasants. Their internationalism has nothing
    to do with the International. I had not been
    in Ireland many hours when several people
    mentioned to me with considerable excitement
    some news from the Continent. They were
    not, strange as it may seem, dancing with joy
    over the disaster of Caporetto, or glowing with
    admiration of the Crown Prince. Few really
    rejoiced in English defeats; and none really
    rejoiced in German victories. It was news
    about the Bolshevists; but it was not the news
    of how nobly they had given votes to the
    Russian women, nor of how savagely they had
    fired bullets into the Russian princesses. It
    was the news of a check to the Bolshevists;
    but it was not a glorification of Kerensky or
    Korniloff, or any of the newspaper heroes who
    seem to have satisfied us all, so long as their
    names began with K and nobody knew anything
    about them. In short, it was nothing that
    could be found in all our myriad newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
    articles on the subject. I would give an
    educated Englishman a hundred guesses about
    what it was; but even if he knew it he would
    not know what it meant.</p>
  <p>It had appeared in the little paper about
    peasant produce so successfully conducted by
    Mr George Russell, the admirable ‘A. E.,’
    and it was told me eagerly by the poet himself,
    by a learned and brilliant Jesuit, and by several
    other people, as the great news from Europe.
    It was simply the news that the Jewish Socialists
    of the Bolshevist Government had been attempting
    to confiscate the peasants’ savings in the
    co-operative banks; and had been forced to
    desist. And they spoke of it as of a great
    battle won on the Danube or the Rhine. That
    is what I mean when I say that these people are
    of a pattern and belong to a system which cuts
    across all our own political divisions. They
    felt themselves fighting the Socialist as fiercely
    as any Capitalist can feel it. But they not only
    knew what they were fighting against, but what
    they were fighting for; which is more than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
    Capitalist does. I do not know how far modern
    Europe really shows a menace of Bolshevism,
    or how far merely a panic of Capitalism. But
    I know that if any honest resistance has to be
    offered to mere robbery, the resistance of
    Ireland will be the most honest, and probably
    the most important. It may be that international
    Israel will launch against us out of the
    East an insane simplification of the unity of
    Man, as Islam once launched out of the East
    an insane simplification of the unity of God.
    If it be so, it is where property is well distributed
    that it will be well defended. The post
    of honour will be with those who fight in very
    truth for their own land. If ever there came
    such a drive of wild dervishes against us,
    it would be the chariots and elephants of
    plutocracy that would roll in confusion and
    rout; and the squares of the peasant infantry
    would stand.</p>
  <p>Anyhow, the first fact to realise is that we
    are dealing with a European peasantry; and
    it would be really better, as I say, to think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
    it first as a Continental peasantry. There are
    numberless important inferences from this
    fact; but there is one point, politically topical
    and urgent, on which I may well touch here.
    It will be well to understand about this
    peasantry something that we generally misunderstand,
    even about a Continental peasantry.
    English tourists in France or Italy commonly
    make the mistake of supposing that the people
    cheat, because the people bargain, or attempt
    to bargain. When a peasant asks tenpence for
    something that is worth fourpence, the tourist
    misunderstands the whole problem. He
    commonly solves it by calling the man a thief
    and paying the tenpence. There are ten
    thousand errors in this, beginning with the
    primary error of an oligarchy, of treating a
    man as a servant when he feels more like a
    small squire. The peasant does not choose to
    receive insults; but he never expected to
    receive tenpence. A man who understood him
    would simply suggest twopence, in a calm and
    courteous manner; and the two would eventually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
    meet in the middle at a perfectly just price.
    There would not be what we call a fixed price
    at the beginning, but there would be a very
    firmly fixed price at the end: that is, the bargain
    once made would be a sacredly sealed contract.
    The peasant, so far from cheating, has his own
    horror of cheating; and certainly his own fury
    at being cheated. Now in the political bargain
    with the English, the Irish simply think they
    have been cheated. They think Home Rule
    was stolen from them <i>after</i> the contract was
    sealed; and it will be hard for any one to
    contradict them. If ‘<i>le Roi le veult</i>’ is not a
    sacred seal on a contract, what is? The sentiment
    is stronger because the contract was a
    compromise. Home Rule was the fourpence
    and not the tenpence; and, in perfect loyalty
    to the peasant’s code of honour, they have now
    reverted to the tenpence. The Irish have now
    returned in a reaction of anger to their most
    extreme demands; <i>not</i> because we denied what
    they demanded, but because we denied what
    we accepted. As I shall have occasion to note,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
    there are other and wilder elements in the
    quarrel; but the first fact to remember is that
    the quarrel began with a bargain, that it will
    probably have to end with another bargain;
    and that it will be a bargain with peasants. On
    the whole, in spite of abominable blunders and
    bad faith, I think there is still a chance of
    bargaining, but we must see that there is no
    chance of cheating. We may haggle like
    peasants, and remember that their first offer is
    not necessarily their last. But we must be as
    honest as peasants; and that is a hard saying
    for politicians. The great Parnell, a squire who
    had many of the qualities of a peasant (qualities
    the English so wildly misunderstood as to
    think them English, when they were really
    very Irish) converted his people from a Fenianism
    fiercer than Sinn Fein to a Home Rule more
    moderate than that which any sane statesmanship
    would now offer to Ireland. But the
    peasants trusted Parnell, not because they
    thought he was asking for it, but because they
    thought he could get it. Whatever we decide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
    to give to Ireland, we must give it; it is now
    worse than useless to promise it. I will say
    here, once and for all, the hardest thing that an
    Englishman has to say of his impressions of
    another great European people; that over all
    those hills and valleys our word is wind, and
    our bond is waste paper.</p>
  <p>But, in any case, the peasantry remains: and
    the whole weight of the matter is that it will
    remain. It is much more certain to remain
    than any of the commercial or colonial systems
    that will have to bargain with it. We may
    honestly think that the British Empire is both
    more liberal and more lasting than the Austrian
    Empire, or other large political combinations.
    But a combination like the Austrian Empire
    could go to pieces, and ten such combinations
    could go to pieces, before people like the
    Serbians ceased to desire to be peasants, and
    to demand to be free peasants. And the
    British combination, precisely because it is a
    combination and not a community, is in its
    nature more lax and liable to real schism than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
    this sort of community, which might almost be
    called a communion. Any attack on it is like
    an attempt to abolish grass; which is not only
    the symbol of it in the old national song, but
    it is a very true symbol of it in any new philosophic
    history; a symbol of its equality, its
    ubiquity, its multiplicity, and its mighty power
    to return. To fight against grass is to fight
    against God; we can only so mismanage our
    own city and our own citizenship that the grass
    grows in our own streets. And even then it is
    our streets that will be dead; and the grass
    will still be alive.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an old joke of my childhood, to the
    effect that men might be grouped together with
    reference to their Christian names. I have
    forgotten the cases then under consideration;
    but contemporary examples would be sufficiently
    suggestive to-day. A ceremonial brotherhood-in-arms
    between Father Bernard Vaughan and
    Mr Bernard Shaw seems full of possibilities.
    I am faintly pleased with the fancy of Mr
    Arnold Bennett endeavouring to extract the
    larger humanities of fiction from the political
    differences of Mr Arnold White and Mr Arnold
    Lupton. I should pass my own days in the
    exclusive society of Professor Gilbert Murray
    and Sir Gilbert Parker; whom I can conceive
    as differing on some points from each other,
    and on some points from me. Now there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
    one odd thing to notice about this old joke;
    that it might have been taken in a more serious
    spirit, though in a saner style, in a yet older
    period. This fantasy of the Victorian Age
    might easily have been a fact of the Middle
    Ages. There would have been nothing abnormal
    in the moral atmosphere of mediævalism
    in some feast or pageant celebrating the fellowship
    of men who had the same patron saint.
    It seems mad and meaningless now, because
    the meaning of Christian names has been lost.
    They have fallen into a kind of chaos and
    oblivion which is highly typical of our time.
    I mean that there are still fashions in them, but
    no longer reasons for them. For a fashion is
    a custom without a cause. A fashion is a custom
    to which men cannot get accustomed; simply
    because it is without a cause. That is why our
    industrial societies, touching every topic from
    the cosmos to the coat-collars, are merely swept
    by a succession of modes which are merely
    moods. They are customs that fail to be
    customary. And so amid all our fashions in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
    Christian names, we have forgotten all that was
    meant by the custom of Christian names. We
    have forgotten all the original facts about a
    Christian name; but, above all, the fact that it
    was Christian.</p>
  <p>Now if we note this process going on in the
    world of London or Liverpool, we shall see
    that it has already gone even farther and fared
    even worse. The surname also is losing its
    root and therefore its reason. The surname
    has become as solitary as a nickname. For it
    might be argued that the first name is meant
    to be an individual and even isolated thing;
    but the last name is certainly meant, by all logic
    and history, to link a man with his human
    origins, habits, or habitation. Historically, it
    was a word taken from the town he lived in or
    the trade guild to which he belonged; legally
    it is still the word on which all questions
    of legitimacy, succession, and testamentary
    arrangements turn. It is meant to be the
    corporate name; in that sense it is meant to be
    the impersonal name, as the other is meant to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
    be the personal name. Yet in the modern mode
    of industrialism, it is more and more taken in
    a manner at once lonely and light. Any
    corporate social system built upon it would
    seem as much of a joke as the joke about
    Christian names with which I began. If it
    would seem odd to require a Thomas to make
    friends with any other Thomas, it would appear
    almost as perplexing to insist that any Thompson
    must love any other Thompson. It may
    be that Sir Edward Henry, late of the Police
    Force, does not wish to be confined to the
    society of Mr Edward Clodd. But would Sir
    Edward Henry necessarily seek the society of
    Mr O. Henry, entertaining as that society
    would be? Sir John Barker, founder of the
    great Kensington emporium, need not specially
    seek out and embrace Mr John Masefield;
    but need he, any more swiftly, precipitate himself
    into the arms of Mr Granville Barker?
    This vista of varieties would lead us far; but
    it is enough to notice, nonsense apart, that the
    most ordinary English surnames have become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
    unique in their social significance; they stand
    for the man rather than the race or the origins.
    Even when they are most common they are
    not communal. What we call the family name
    is not now primarily the name of the family.
    The family itself, as a corporate conception, has
    already faded into the background, and is
    in danger of fading from the background. In
    short, our Christian names are not the only
    Christian things that we may lose.</p>
  <p>Now the second solid fact which struck me
    in Ireland (after the success of small property
    and the <i>failure</i> of large organisation) was the
    fact that the family was in a flatly contrary
    position. All I have said above, in current
    language, about the whole trend of the modern
    world, is directly opposite to the whole trend
    of the modern Irish world. Not only is the
    Christian name a Christian name; but (what
    seems still more paradoxical and even pantomimic)
    the family name is really a family name.
    Touching the first of the two, it would be easy
    to trace out some very interesting truths about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
    it, if they did not divert us from the main
    truth of this chapter; the second great truth
    about Ireland. People contrasting the ‘education’
    of the two countries, or seeking to
    extend to the one the thing which is called
    education in the other, might indeed do worse
    than study the simple problem of the meaning
    of Christian names. It might dawn at last,
    even on educationists, that there is a value in
    the content as well as the extent of culture; or
    (in other words), that knowing nine hundred
    words is not always more important than knowing
    what some of them mean. It is strictly and
    soberly true that any peasant, in a mud cabin
    in County Clare, when he names his child
    Michael, may really have a sense of the presence
    that smote down Satan, the arms and plumage
    of the paladin of paradise. I doubt whether it is
    so overwhelmingly probable that any clerk in
    any villa on Clapham Common, when he names
    his son John, has a vision of the holy eagle of the
    Apocalypse, or even of the mystical cup of the
    disciple whom Jesus loved. In the face of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
    simple fact, I have no doubt about which is
    the more educated man; and even a knowledge
    of the <i>Daily Mail</i> does not redress the balance.
    It is often said, and possibly truly, that the
    peasant named Michael cannot write his own
    name. But it is quite equally true that the
    clerk named John cannot read his own name.
    He cannot read it because it is in a foreign
    language, and he has never been made to
    realise what it stands for. He does not know
    that John means John, as the other man does
    know that Michael means Michael. In that
    rigidly realistic sense, the pupil of industrial
    intellectualism does not even know his own
    name.</p>
  <p>But this is a parenthesis; because the point
    here is that the man in the street (as distinct
    from the man in the field) has been separated
    not only from his private but from his more
    public description. He has not only forgotten
    his name, but forgotten his address. In my
    own view, he is like one of those unfortunate
    people who wake up with their minds a blank,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
    and therefore cannot find their way home.
    But whether or no we take this view of the
    state of things in an industrial society like the
    English, we must realise firmly that a totally
    opposite state of things exists in an agricultural
    society like the Irish. We may put it, if we like,
    in the form of an unfamiliar and even unfriendly
    fancy. We may say that the house is greater
    than the man; that the house is an amiable
    ogre that runs after and recaptures the man.
    But the fact is there, familiar or unfamiliar,
    friendly or unfriendly; and the fact is the
    family. The family pride is prodigious,
    though it generally goes along with glowing
    masses of individual humility. And this family
    sentiment does attach itself to the family name;
    so that the very language in which men think
    is made up of family names. In this the
    atmosphere is singularly unlike that of England
    though much more like that of Scotland. Indeed,
    it will illustrate the impartial recognition
    of this, apart from any partisan deductions,
    that it is equally apparent in the place where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
    Ireland and Scotland are supposed to meet.
    It is equally apparent in Ulster, and even in
    the Protestant corner of Ulster.</p>
  <p>In all the Ulster propaganda I came across,
    I think the thing that struck me most sharply
    was one phrase in one Unionist leading article.
    It was something that might fairly be called
    Scottish; something which was really even
    more Irish; but something which could not in
    the wildest mood be called English, and therefore
    could not with any rational meaning be
    called Unionist. Yet it was part of a passionately
    sincere, and indeed truly human and
    historic outburst of the politics of the north-east
    corner, against the politics of the rest of
    Ireland. Most of us remember that Sir
    Edward Carson put into the Government a
    legal friend of his named Campbell; it was at
    the beginning of the war, and few of us thought
    anything of the matter except that it was stupid
    to give posts to Carsonites at the most delicate
    crisis of the cause in Ireland. Since then, as
    we also know, the same Campbell has shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
    himself a sensible man, which I should translate
    as a practical Home Ruler; but which is anyhow
    something more than what is generally
    meant by a Carsonite. I entertain, myself, a
    profound suspicion that Carson also would very
    much like to be something more than a Carsonite.
    But however this may be, his legal
    friend of whom I speak made an excellent
    speech, containing some concession to Irish
    popular sentiment. As might have been
    expected, there were furious denunciations of
    him in the press of the Orange party; but
    not more furious than might have been
    found in the <i>Morning Post</i> or any Tory paper.
    Nevertheless, there was one phrase that I certainly
    never saw in the <i>Morning Post</i> or the
    <i>Saturday Review</i>; one phrase I should never
    expect to see in any English paper, though I
    might very probably see it in a Scotch paper.
    It was this sentence, that was read to me from
    the leading article of a paper in Belfast: ‘There
    never was treason yet but a Campbell was at
    the bottom of it.’ I give the extract as it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
    given to me; I am quite conscious of a curious
    historical paradox about it. A curse against
    Campbells would seem to be a Jacobite rather
    than a Williamite tradition. It may suggest
    interesting complications of Scottish feuds in
    Ireland; but it serves as one of a thousand
    cases of this fact about the family.
  </p>
  <p>Let anybody imagine an Englishman saying,
    about some business quarrel, ‘How like an
    Atkins!’ or ‘What could you expect of a
    Wilkinson?’ A moment’s reflection will show
    that it would be even more impossible touching
    public men in public quarrels. No English
    Liberal ever connected the earlier exploits of
    the present Lord Birkenhead with atavistic
    influences, or the totem of the wide and wandering
    tribe of Smith. No English patriot traced
    back the family tree of any English pacifist;
    or said there was never treason yet but a
    Pringle was at the bottom of it. It is the
    indefinite article that is here the definite distinction.
    It is the expression ‘a Campbell’
    which suddenly transforms the scene, and covers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
    the robes of one lawyer with the ten thousand
    tartans of a whole clan. Now that phrase is
    the phrase that meets the traveller everywhere
    in Ireland. Perhaps the next most arresting
    thing I remember, after the agrarian revolution,
    was the way in which one poor Irishman
    happened to speak to me about Sir Roger
    Casement. He did not praise him as a deliverer
    of Ireland; he did not abuse him as a disgrace
    to Ireland; he did not say anything of the
    twenty things one might expect him to say.
    He merely referred to the rumour that Casement
    meant to become a Catholic just before
    his execution, and expressed a sort of distant
    interest in it. He added: ‘He’s always been
    a Black Protestant. All the Casements are
    Black Protestants.’ I confess that, at that
    moment of that morbid story, there seemed to
    me to be something unearthly about the very
    idea of there being other Casements. If ever
    a man seemed solitary, if ever a man seemed
    unique to the point of being unnatural, it was
    that man on the two or three occasions when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
    I have seen his sombre handsome face and his
    wild eye; a tall, dark figure walking already
    in the shadow of a dreadful doom. I do not
    know if he was a Black Protestant; but he was
    a black something, in the sad if not the bad
    sense of the symbol. I fancy, in truth, he stood
    rather for the third of Browning’s famous triad
    of rhyming monosyllables. A distinguished
    Nationalist Member, who happened to have
    had a medical training, said to me, ‘I was quite
    certain, when I first clapped eyes on him, the
    man was mad.’ Anyhow the man was so
    unusual, that it would never have occurred to
    me or any of my countrymen to talk as if there
    were a class or clan of such men. I could
    almost have imagined he had been born without
    father or mother. But for the Irish, his
    father and mother were really more important
    than he was. There is said to be a historical
    mystery about whether Parnell made a pun
    when he said that the name of Kettle was a
    household word in Ireland. Few symbols
    could now be more contrary than the name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
    Kettle and the name of Casement (save for the
    courage they had in common); for the younger
    Kettle, who died so gloriously in France, was
    a Nationalist as broad as the other was cramped,
    and as sane as the other was crazy. But if the
    fancy of a punster, following his own delightful
    vein of nonsense, should see something quaint
    in the image of a hundred such Kettles singing
    as he sang by a hundred hearths, a more bitter
    jester, reading that black and obscure story of
    the capture on the coast, might utter a similar
    flippancy about other Casements, opening on the
    foam of such very perilous seas, in a land so
    truly forlorn. But even if we were not annoyed
    at the pun, we should be surprised at the plural.
    And our surprise would be the measure of
    the deepest difference between England and
    Ireland. To express it in the same idle imagery,
    it would be the fact that even a casement is a
    part of a house, as a kettle is a part of a household.
    Every word in Irish is a household word.</p>
  <p>The English would no more have thought
    of a plural for the word Gladstone than for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
    word God. They would never have imagined
    Disraeli compassed about with a great cloud of
    Disraelis; it would have seemed to them
    altogether too apocalyptic an exaggeration
    of being on the side of the angels. To this day
    in England, as I have reason to know, it is
    regarded as a rabid and insane form of religious
    persecution to suggest that a Jew very probably
    comes of a Jewish family. In short, the modern
    English, while their rulers are willing to give
    due consideration to Eugenics as a reasonable
    opportunity for various forms of polygamy
    and infanticide, are drifting farther and farther
    from the only consideration of Eugenics that
    could possibly be fit for Christian men, the
    consideration of it as an accomplished fact.
    I have spoken of infanticide; but indeed the
    ethic involved is rather that of parricide and
    matricide. To my own taste, the present
    tendency of social reform would seem to consist
    of destroying all traces of the parents, in order
    to study the heredity of the children. But I do
    not here ask the reader to accept my own tastes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
    or even opinions about these things; I only
    bear witness to an objective fact about a foreign
    country. It can be summed up by saying that
    Parnell is the Parnell for the English; but a
    Parnell for the Irish.</p>
  <p>This is what I mean when I say that English
    Home Rulers do not know what the Irish mean
    by home. And this is also what I mean when
    I say that the society does not fit into any of
    our social classifications, liberal or conservative.
    To many Radicals this sense of lineage will
    appear rank reactionary aristocracy. And it
    is aristocratic, if we mean by this a pride of
    pedigree; but it is not aristocratic in the practical
    and political sense. Strange as it may
    sound, its practical effect is democratic. It is
    not aristocratic in the sense of creating an
    aristocracy. On the contrary, it is perhaps the
    one force that permanently prevents the
    creation of an aristocracy, in the manner of the
    English squirearchy. The reason of this
    apparent paradox can be put plainly enough in
    one sentence. If you are <i>really</i> concerned about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
    your relations, you have to be concerned about
    your poor relations. You soon discover that
    a considerable number of your second cousins
    exhibit a strong social tendency to be chimney-sweeps
    and tinkers. You soon learn the lesson
    of human equality, if you try honestly and consistently
    to learn any other lesson, even the
    lesson of heraldry and genealogy. For good
    or evil, a real working aristocracy has to forget
    about three-quarters of its aristocrats. It has
    to discard the poor who have the genteel blood,
    and welcome the rich who can live the genteel
    life. If a man is interesting because he is a
    McCarthy, it is so far as he is interesting
    because he is a man; that is, he is interesting
    whether he is a duke or a dustman. But if he
    is interesting because he is Lord FitzArthur
    and lives at FitzArthur House, then he is
    interesting when he has merely bought the
    house, or when he has merely bought the title.
    To maintain a squirearchy it is necessary to
    admire the new squire, and therefore to forget
    the old squire. The sense of family is like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
    dog and follows the family; the sense of
    aristocracy is like a cat and continues to haunt
    the house. I am not arguing against aristocracy,
    if the English choose to preserve it in England;
    I am only making clear the terms on which
    they hold it, and warning them that a people
    with a strong family sense will not hold it on
    any terms. Aristocracy, as it has flourished in
    England since the Reformation, with not a
    little national glory and commercial success, is
    in its very nature built up of broken and
    desecrated homes. It has to destroy a hundred
    poor relations to keep up a family. It has to
    destroy a hundred families to keep up a class.</p>
  <p>But if this family spirit is incompatible with
    what we mean by aristocracy, it is quite as
    incompatible with three-quarters of what many
    men praise and preach as democracy. The
    whole trend of what has been regarded as Liberal
    legislation in England, necessary or unnecessary,
    defensible and indefensible, has for good
    or evil been at the expense of the independence
    of the family, especially of the poor family.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
    From the first most reasonable restraints of the
    Factory Acts to the last most maniacal antics of
    interference with other people’s nursery games
    or Christmas dinners, the whole process has
    turned sometimes on the pivot of the State,
    more often on the pivot of the employer, but
    never on the pivot of the home. All this may
    be an emancipation; I only point out that
    Ireland really asked for Home Rule chiefly to
    be emancipated from this emancipation. But
    indeed the English politicians, to do them
    justice, show their consciousness of this by the
    increasing number of cases in which the other
    nation is exempted. We may have harried
    this unhappy people with our persecutions;
    but at least we spare them our reforms. We
    have smitten them with plagues; but at least
    we dare not scourge them with our remedies.
    The real case against the Union is not merely
    a case against the Unionists; it is a far stronger
    case against the Universalists. It is this strange
    and ironic truth; that a man stands up holding
    a charter of charity and peace for all mankind;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
    that he lays down a law of enlightened justice
    for all the nations of the earth; that he claims
    to behold man from the beginnings of his
    evolution equal, without any difference between
    the most distant creeds and colours; that he
    stands as the orator of the human race, whose
    statute only declares all humanity to be human;
    and then slightly drops his voice and says,
    ‘This Act shall not apply to Ireland.’</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">THE PARADOX OF LABOUR</h2>
  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">My</span> first general and visual impression of the
    green island was that it was not green but
    brown; that it was positively brown with
    khaki. This is one of those experiences that
    cannot be confused with expectations; the sort
    of small thing that is seen but not foreseen in
    the verbal visions of books and newspapers.
    I knew, of course, that we had a garrison in
    Dublin, but I had no notion that it was so
    obvious all over Dublin. I had no notion that
    it had been considered necessary to occupy the
    country in such force, or with so much parade
    of force. And the first thought that flashed
    through my mind found words in the single
    sentence: ‘How useful these men would have
    been in the breach at St Quentin.’</p>
  <p>For I went to Dublin towards the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
    1918, and not long after those awful days
    which led up to the end of the war, and seemed
    more like the end of the world. There hung
    still in the imagination, as above a void of
    horror, that line that was the last chain of the
    world’s chivalry; and the memory of the day
    when it seemed that our name and our greatness
    and our glory went down before the
    annihilation from the north. Ireland is hardly
    to blame if she has never known how noble an
    England was in peril in that hour; or for what
    beyond any empire we were troubled when,
    under a cloud of thick darkness, we almost felt
    her ancient foundations move upon the floor
    of the sea. But I, as an Englishman, at least
    knew it; and it was for England and not for
    Ireland that I felt this first impatience and
    tragic irony. I had always doubted the military
    policy that culminated in Irish conscription,
    and merely on military grounds. If any policy
    of the English could deserve to be called in the
    proverbial sense Irish, I think it was this one.
    It was wasting troops in Ireland because we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
    wanted them in France. I had the same purely
    patriotic and even pugnacious sense of annoyance,
    mingling with my sense of pathos, in the
    sight of the devastation of the great Dublin
    street, which had been bombarded by the
    British troops during the Easter Rebellion. I
    was bitterly distressed that such a cannonade had
    ever been aimed at the Irish; but even more
    distressed that it had not been aimed at the
    Germans. The question of the necessity of the
    heavy attack, like the question of the necessity
    of the large army of occupation, is of course
    bound up with the history of the Easter
    Rebellion itself. That strange and dramatic
    event, which came quite as unexpectedly to
    Nationalist Ireland as to Unionist England, is
    no part of my own experiences, and I will not
    dogmatise on so dark a problem. But I will say,
    in passing, that I suspect a certain misunderstanding
    of its very nature to be common on
    both sides. Everything seems to point to the
    paradox that the rebels needed the less to be
    conquered, because they were actually aiming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
    at being conquered, rather than at being conquerors.
    In the moral sense they were most
    certainly heroes, but I doubt if they expected
    to be conquering heroes. They desired to be
    in the Greek and literal sense martyrs; they
    wished not so much to win as to witness. They
    thought that nothing but their dead bodies
    could really prove that Ireland was not dead.
    How far this sublime and suicidal ideal was
    really useful in reviving national enthusiasm
    it is for Irishmen to judge; I should have said
    that the enthusiasm was there anyhow. But if
    any such action is based on international hopes,
    as they affect England or a great part of
    America, it seems to me founded on a fallacy
    about the facts. I shall have occasion to note
    many English errors about the Irish; and this
    seems to me a very notable Irish error about
    the English. If we are often utterly mistaken
    about their mentality, they were quite equally
    mistaken about our mistake. And curiously
    enough, they failed through not knowing the
    one compliment that we had really always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
    paid them. Their act presupposed that Irish
    courage needed proof; and it never did. I
    have heard all the most horrible nonsense
    talked against Ireland before the war; and I
    never heard Englishmen doubt Irish military
    valour. What they did doubt was Irish political
    sanity. It will be seen at once that the Easter
    action could only disprove the prejudice they
    hadn’t got, and actually confirmed the prejudice
    they had got. The charge against the
    Irishman was not a lack of boldness, but rather
    an excess of it. Men were right in thinking
    him brave, and they could not be more right.
    But they were wrong in thinking him mad, and
    they had an excellent opportunity to be more
    wrong. Then, when the attempt to fight
    against England developed by its own logic into
    a refusal to fight for England, men took away
    the number they first thought of, and were
    irritated into denying what they had originally
    never dreamed of doubting. In any case, this
    was, I think, the temper in which the minority
    of the true Sinn Feiners sought martyrdom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
    I for one will never sneer at such a motive; but
    it would hardly have amounted to so great a
    movement but for another force that happened
    to ally itself with them. It is for the sake of
    this that I have here begun with the Easter
    tragedy itself; for with the consideration of
    this we come to the paradox of Irish Labour.</p>
  <p>Some of my remarks on the stability and even
    repose of a peasant society may seem exaggerated
    in the light of a Labour agitation that
    breaks out in Ireland as elsewhere. But I have
    particular and even personal reasons for regarding
    that agitation as the exception that proves
    the rule. It was the background of the peasant
    landscape that made the Dublin strike the
    peculiar sort of drama that it was; and this
    operated in two ways; first, by isolating the
    industrial capitalist as something exceptional
    and almost fanatical; and second, by reinforcing
    the proletariat with a vague tradition
    of property. My own sympathies were all
    with Larkin and Connolly as against the late
    Mr Murphy; but it is curious to note that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
    even Mr Murphy was quite a different kind of
    man from the Lord Something who is the head
    of a commercial combine in England. He was
    much more like some morbid prince of the
    fifteenth century, full of cold anger, not without
    perverted piety. But the first few words
    I heard about him in Ireland were full of that
    vast, vague fact which I have tried to put first
    among my impressions. I have called it the
    family; but it covers many cognate things;
    youth and old friendships, not to mention old
    quarrels. It might be more fully defined as
    a realism about origins. The first things I
    heard about Murphy were facts of his forgotten
    youth, or a youth that would in England have
    been forgotten. They were tales about friends
    of his simpler days, with whom he had set out
    to push some more or less sentimental vendetta
    against somebody. Suppose whenever we
    talked of Harrod’s Stores we heard first about
    the boyish day-dreams of Harrod. Suppose
    the mention of Bradshaw’s Railway Guide
    brought up tales of feud and first love in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
    early life of Mr Bradshaw, or even of Mrs
    Bradshaw. That is the atmosphere, to be felt
    rather than described, that a stranger in
    Ireland feels around him. English journalism
    and gossip, dealing with English business men,
    are often precise about the present and prophetic
    about the future, but seldom communicative
    about the past; <i>et pour cause</i>. They will
    tell us where the capitalist is going to, as to
    the House of Lords, or to Monte Carlo, or
    inferentially to heaven; but they say as little
    as possible about where he comes from. In
    Ireland a man carries the family mansion
    about with him like a snail; and his father’s
    ghost follows him like his shadow. Everything
    good and bad that could be said was
    said, not only about Murphy but about
    Murphys. An anecdote of the old Irish Parliament
    describes an orator as gracefully alluding
    to the presence of an opponent’s sister in the
    Ladies’ Gallery, by praying that wrath overtake
    the whole accursed generation ‘from the
    toothless old hag who is grinning in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
    gallery to the white-livered poltroon who is
    shivering on the floor.’ The story is commonly
    told as suggesting the rather wild disunion of
    Irish parties; but it is quite as important a
    suggestion of the union of Irish families.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, the great Dublin Strike,
    a conflagration of which the embers were still
    glowing at the time of my visit, involved another
    episode which illustrates once again this recurrent
    principle of the reality of the family in
    Ireland. Some English Socialists, it may be
    remembered, moved by an honourable pity for
    the poor families starving during the strike,
    made a proposal for taking the children away
    and feeding them properly in England. I
    should have thought the more natural course
    would have been to give money or food to the
    parents. But the philanthropists, being
    English and being Socialists, probably had a
    trust in what is called organisation and a distrust
    of what is called charity. It is supposed
    that charity makes a man dependent; though
    in fact charity makes him independent, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
    compared with the dreary dependence usually
    produced by organisation. Charity gives
    property, and therefore liberty. There is
    manifestly much more emancipation in giving
    a beggar a shilling to spend, than in sending
    an official after him to spend it for him. The
    Socialists, however, had placidly arranged for
    the deportation of all the poor children, when
    they found themselves, to their astonishment,
    confronted with the red-hot reality called the
    religion of Ireland. The priests and the
    families of the faithful organised themselves
    for a furious agitation, on the ground that the
    faith would be lost in foreign and heretical
    homes. They were not satisfied with the assurance,
    which some of the Socialists earnestly
    offered, that the faith would not be tampered
    with; and, as a matter of clear thinking, I
    think they were quite right. Those who offer
    such a reassurance have never thought about
    what a religion is. They entertain the extraordinary
    idea that religion is a topic. They
    think religion is a thing like radishes, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
    can be avoided throughout a particular conversation
    with a particular person, whom the
    mention of a radish may convulse with anger
    or agony. But a religion is simply the world
    a man inhabits. In practice, a Socialist living
    in Liverpool would not know when he was or
    was not tampering with the religion of a child
    born in Louth. If I were given the complete
    control of an infant Parsee (which is fortunately
    unlikely) I should not have the remotest notion
    of when I was most vitally reflecting on the
    Parsee system. But common sense, and a
    comprehension of the meaning of a coherent
    philosophy, would lead me to suspect that I
    was reflecting on it every other minute. But
    I mention the matter here, not in order to enter
    into any of these disputes, but to give yet
    another example of the way in which the
    essentially domestic organisation of Ireland
    will always rise in rebellion against any other
    organisation. There is something of a parable
    in the tales of the old evictions, in which the
    whole family was besieged and resisted together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
    and the mothers emptied boiling kettles on the
    besiegers; for any official who interferes with
    them will certainly get into hot water. We
    cannot separate mothers and children in that
    strange land. We can only return to some of
    our older historical methods and massacre
    them together.</p>
  <p>A small incident within my own short
    experience, however, illustrated the main point
    involved here; the sense of a peasant base even
    of the proletarian attack. And this was
    exemplified not in any check to Labour, but
    rather in a success for Labour, in so far as the
    issue of a friendly and informal debate may be
    classed with its more solid successes. The
    business originally began with a sort of loose-jointed
    literary lecture which I gave in the
    Dublin Theatre, in connection with which I
    only mention two incidents in passing, because
    they both struck me as peculiarly native and
    national. One concerned only the title of my
    address, which was ‘Poetry and Property.’
    An educated English gentleman, who happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
    to speak to me before the meeting, said with the
    air of one who foresees that such jokes will be
    the death of him, ‘Well, I have simply given
    up puzzling about what you can possibly mean,
    by talking about poetry as something to do
    with property.’ He probably regarded the
    combination of words as a mere alliterative
    fantasy, like Peacocks and Paddington, or
    Polygamy and Potatoes; if indeed he did not
    regard it as a mere combination of incompatible
    contrasts, like Popery and Protestants, or
    Patriotism and Politicians. On the same day
    an Irishman of similar social standing remarked
    quite carelessly, ‘I’ve just seen your subject
    for to-morrow. I suppose the Socialists will
    reply to you,’ or words to that effect. The
    two terms told him at once, not about the
    lecture (which was literary if it was anything),
    but about the whole philosophy underlying
    the lecture; the whole of that philosophy which
    the lumbering elephant called by Mr Shaw the
    Chesterbelloc laboriously toils to explain in
    England, under the ponderous title of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
    Distributivism. As Mr Hugh Law once said,
    equally truly, about our pitting of patriotism
    against imperialism, ‘What is a paradox in
    England is a commonplace in Ireland.’ My
    actual monologue, however, dealt merely with
    the witness of poetry to a certain dignity in
    man’s sense of private possessions, which is
    certainly not either vulgar ostentation or vulgar
    greed. The French poet of the Pleiade remembers
    the slates on his own roof almost as if he
    could count them. And Mr W. B. Yeats, in
    the very wildest vision of a loneliness remote
    and irresponsible, is careful to make it clear
    that he knows how many bean-rows make nine.
    Of course there were people of all parties in
    the theatre, wild Sinn Feiners and conventional
    Unionists, but they all listened to my remarks
    as naturally as they might have all listened to
    an equally incompetent lecture on Monkeys
    or on the Mountains of the Moon. There was
    not a word of politics, least of all party politics,
    in that particular speech; it was concerned with
    a tradition in art, or at the most, in abstract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
    ethics. But the one amusing thing which makes
    me recall the whole incident was this; that
    when I had finished a stalwart, hearty, heavy
    sort of legal gentleman, a well-known Irish
    judge I understand, was kind enough to move
    a vote of thanks to me. And what amused me
    about him was this: that while I (who am a
    Radical, in sympathy with the revolutionary
    legend) had delivered a mild essay on minor
    poets to a placid if bored audience, the judge,
    who was a pillar of the Castle and a Conservative
    sworn to law and order, proceeded with
    the utmost energy and joy to raise a riot. He
    taunted the Sinn Feiners and dared them to
    come out; he trailed his coat if ever a man
    trailed it in this world; he glorified England;
    not the Allies, but England; splendid England,
    sublime England (all in the broadest brogue),
    just, wise, and merciful England, and so on,
    flourishing what was not even the flag of his
    own country, and a thing that had not the
    remotest connection with the subject in hand,
    any more than the Great Wall of China. I need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
    not say that the theatre was soon in a roar of
    protests and repartees; which I suppose was
    what he wanted. He was a jolly old gentleman,
    and I liked him. But what interested me about
    him was this; and it is of some importance in
    the understanding of his nationality. That sort
    of man exists in England; I know and like
    scores of him. Often he is a major; often a
    squire; sometimes a judge; very occasionally
    a dean. Such a man talks the most ridiculous
    reactionary nonsense in an apoplectic fashion
    over his own port wine; and occasionally in a
    somewhat gasping manner at an avowedly
    political meeting. But precisely what the
    English gentleman would not do, and the Irish
    gentleman did do, would be to make a scene
    on a non-political occasion; when all he had
    to do was to move a formal vote of thanks to a
    total stranger, who was talking about Ithaca
    and Innisfree. An English Conservative would
    be less likely to do it than an English Radical.
    The same thing that makes him conventionally
    political would make him conventionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
    non-political. He would hate to make too serious
    a speech on too social an occasion, as he would
    hate to be in morning-dress when every one
    else was in evening dress. And whatever coat
    he wore he certainly would not trail it solely in
    order to make a disturbance, as did that jolly
    Irish judge. He taught me that the Irishman
    is never so Irish as when he is English. He
    was very like some of the Sinn Feiners who
    shouted him down; and he would be pleased
    to know that he helped me to understand them
    with a greater sympathy.</p>
  <p>I have wandered from the subject in speaking
    of this trifle, thinking it worth while to note the
    positive and provocative quality of all Irish
    opinion; but it was my purpose only to mention
    this small dispute as leading up to another.
    I had some further talk about poetry and
    property with Mr Yeats at the Dublin Arts
    Club; and here again I am tempted to irrelevant
    but for me interesting matters. For I am
    conscious throughout of saying less than I
    could wish of a thousand things, my omission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
    of which is not altogether thoughtless, far less
    thankless. There have been and will be better
    sketches than mine of all that attractive society,
    the paradox of an intelligentsia that is intelligent.
    I could write a great deal, not only
    about those I value as my own friends, like
    Katherine Tynan or Stephen Gwynn, but about
    men with whom my meeting was all too
    momentary; about the elvish energy conveyed
    by Mr James Stephens; the social greatness of
    Dr Gogarty, who was like a witty legend of
    the eighteenth century; of the unique universalism
    of A. E., who has something of the
    presence of William Morris, and a more
    transcendental type of the spiritual hospitality
    of Walt Whitman. But I am not in this rough
    sketch trying to tell Irishmen what they know
    already, but trying to tell Englishmen some of
    the large and simple things that they do not
    always know. The large matter concerned here
    is Labour; and I have only paused upon the
    other points because they were the steps which
    accidentally led up to my first meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
    this great force. And it was none the less a
    fact in support of my argument because it was
    something of a joke against myself.</p>
  <p>On the occasion I have mentioned, a most
    exhilarating evening at the Arts Club, Mr Yeats
    asked me to open a debate at the Abbey
    Theatre, defending property on its more purely
    political side. My opponent was one of the
    ablest of the leaders of Liberty Hall, the
    famous stronghold of Labour politics in Dublin;
    Mr Johnson, an Englishman like myself, but
    one deservedly popular with the proletarian
    Irish. He made a most admirable speech, to
    which I mean no disparagement when I say
    that I think his personal popularity had even
    more weight than his personal eloquence. My
    own argument was confined to the particular
    value of small property as a weapon of militant
    democracy, and was based on the idea that
    the citizen resisting injustice could find no
    substitute for private property; for every other
    impersonal power, however democratic in
    theory, must be bureaucratic in form. I said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
    as a flippant figure of speech, that committing
    property to any officials, even guild officials,
    was like having to leave one’s legs in the cloakroom
    along with one’s stick or umbrella. The
    point is that a man may want his legs at any
    minute, to kick a man or to dance with a lady;
    and recovering them may be postponed by
    any hitch, from the loss of the ticket to the
    criminal flight of the official. So in a social
    crisis, such as a strike, a man must be ready to
    act without officials who may hamper or betray
    him; and I asked whether many more strikes
    would not have been successful, if each striker
    had owned so much as a kitchen garden to help
    him to live. My opponent replied that he had
    always been in favour of such a reserve of
    proletarian property, but preferred it to be
    communal rather than individual; which seems
    to me to leave my argument where it was; for
    what is communal must be official, unless it is
    to be chaotic. Two minor jokes, somewhat at
    my expense, remain in my memory; I appear
    to have caused some amusement by cutting a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
    pencil with a very large Spanish knife, which
    I value (as it happens) as the gift of an Irish
    priest who is a friend of mine, and which may
    therefore also be regarded as a symbolic weapon,
    a sort of sword of the spirit. Whether the
    audience thought I was about to amputate my
    own legs in illustration of my own metaphor,
    or that I was going to cut Mr Johnson’s throat
    in fury at finding no reply to his arguments,
    I do not know. The other thing which struck
    me as funny was an excellent retort by Mr
    Johnson himself, who had said something
    about the waste of property on guns, and who
    interrupted my remark that there would never
    be a good revolution without guns, by humorously
    calling out, ‘Treason.’ As I told him
    afterwards, few scenes would be more artistic
    than that of an Englishman, sent over to recruit
    for the British army, being collared and given
    up to justice (or injustice) by a Pacifist from
    Liberty Hall. But all throughout the proceedings
    I was conscious, as I say, of a very real
    popular feeling supporting the mere personality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
    of my opponent; as in the ovation he received
    before he spoke at all, or the applause given to
    a number of his topical asides, allusions which
    I could not always understand. After the
    meeting a distinguished Southern Unionist,
    who happens to own land outside Dublin, said
    to me, ‘Of course, Johnson has just had a huge
    success in his work here. Liberty Hall has just
    done something that has really never been done
    before in the whole Trade Union movement.
    He has really managed to start a Trade Union
    for agricultural labourers. I know, because
    I’ve had to meet their demands. You know
    how utterly impossible it has always been really
    to found a union of agricultural labourers in
    England.’ I did know it; and I also knew
    why it had been possible to found one in
    Ireland. It had been possible for the very
    reason I had been urging all the evening; that
    behind the Irish proletariat there had been the
    tradition of an Irish peasantry. In their
    families, if not in themselves, there had been
    some memory of the personal love of the land.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
    But it seemed to me an interesting irony that
    even my own defeat was an example of my own
    doctrine; and that the truth on my side was
    proved by the popularity of the other side.
    The agricultural guild was due to a wind of
    freedom that came into that dark city from very
    distant fields; and the truth that even these
    rolling stones of homeless proletarianism had
    been so lately loosened from the very roots of
    the mountains.</p>
  <p>In Ireland even the industrialism is not
    industrial. That is what I mean by saying that
    Irish Labour is the exception that proves the
    rule. That is why it does not contradict my
    former generalisation that our capitalist crisis
    is on the English side of the road. The Irish
    agricultural labourers can become guildsmen
    because they would like to become peasants.
    They think of rich and poor in the manner that
    is as old as the world; the manner of Ahab and
    Naboth. It matters little in a peasant society
    whether Ahab takes the vineyard privately as
    Ahab or officially as King of Israel. It will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
    matter as little in the long run, even in the other
    kind of society, whether Naboth has a wage to
    work in the vineyard, or a vote that is supposed
    in some way to affect the vineyard. What he
    desires to have is the vineyard; and not in
    apologetic cynicism or vulgar evasions that
    business is business, but in thunder, as from a
    secret throne, comes the awful voice out of the
    vineyard; the voice of this manner of man in
    every age and nation: ‘The Lord forbid that
    I should give the inheritance of my fathers
    unto thee.’</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">THE ENGLISHMAN IN IRELAND</h2>
  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">With</span> no desire to decorate my travels with
    too tall a traveller’s tale, I must record the fact
    that I found one point upon which all Irishmen
    were agreed. It was the fact that, for some
    reason or other, there had been a very hopeful
    beginning of Irish volunteering at the beginning
    of the war; and that, for some reason or
    other, this had failed in the course of the war.
    The reasons alleged differed widely with the
    moods of men; some had regarded the beginnings
    with hope and some with suspicion;
    some had lived to regard the failure with a
    bitter pleasure, and some with a generous pain.
    The different factions gave different explanations
    of why the thing had stopped; but they
    all agreed that it had begun. The Sinn Feiner
    said that the people soon found they had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
    lured into a Saxon trap, set for them by smooth
    subservient Saxons like Mr Devlin and Mr
    Tim Healy. The Belfast citizen suggested
    that the Popish priest had terrorised the
    peasants when they tried to enlist, producing a
    thumbscrew from his pocket and a portable
    rack from his handbag. The Parliamentary
    Nationalist blamed both Sinn Fein and the
    persecution of Sinn Fein. The British Government
    officials, if they did not exactly blame
    themselves, at least blamed each other. The
    ordinary Southern Unionist (who played many
    parts of a more or less sensible sort, including
    that of a Home Ruler) generally agreed with
    the ordinary Nationalist that the Government’s
    recruiting methods had been as bad as
    its cause was good. But it is manifest that
    multitudes at the beginning of the war thought
    it really had a very good cause; and, moreover,
    a very good chance.</p>
  <p>The extraordinary story of how that chance
    was lost may find mention on a later page.
    I will begin by touching on the first incident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
    that befell me personally in connection with
    the same enterprise. I went to Ireland at the
    request of Irish friends who were working
    warmly for the Allied cause, and who conceived
    (I fear in far too flattering a spirit) that
    I might at least be useful as an Englishman who
    had always sympathised as warmly with the
    Irish cause. I am under no illusions that I
    should ever be efficient at such work in any case;
    and under the circumstances I had no great
    hopes of doing much, where men like Sir
    Horace Plunkett and Captain Stephen Gwynne,
    far more competent, more self-sacrificing, and
    more well-informed than I, could already do
    comparatively little. It was too late. A
    hundredth part of the brilliant constancy and
    tragic labours of these men might easily, at the
    beginning of the war, have given us a great
    Irish army. I need not explain the motives
    that made me do the little I could do; they
    were the same that at that moment made
    millions of better men do masses of better work.
    Physical accident prevented my being useful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
    in France, and a sort of psychological accident
    seemed to suggest that I might possibly be
    useful in Ireland; but I did not see myself as
    a very serious figure in either field. Nothing
    could be serious in such a case except perhaps
    a conviction; and at least my conviction about
    the great war has never wavered by a hair.
    <i>Delenda est</i>—and it is typical of the power of
    Berlin that one must break off for want of a
    Latin name for it. Being an Englishman, I
    hoped primarily to help England; but not
    being a congenital idiot, I did not primarily
    ask an Irishman to help England. There was
    obviously something much more reasonable to
    ask him to do. I hope I should in any case
    have done my best for my own country. But
    the cause was more than any country; in a
    sense it was too good for any country. The
    Allies were more right than they realised.
    Nay, they hardly had a right to be so right as
    they were. The modern Babylon of capitalistic
    States was hardly worthy to go on such a
    crusade against the heathen; as perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
    decadent Byzantium was hardly worthy to
    defend the Cross against the Crescent. But
    we are glad that it did defend the Cross against
    the Crescent. Nobody is sorry that Sobieski
    relieved Vienna; nobody wishes that Alfred
    had not won in Wessex. The cause that
    conquered is the only cause that survived. We
    see now that its enemy was not a cause but a
    chaos; and that is what history will say of
    the strange and recent boiling up of barbaric
    imperialism, a whirlpool whose hollow centre
    was Berlin. This is where the extreme Irish
    were really wrong; perhaps really wrong for
    the first time, I entirely sympathise with their
    being in revolt against the British Government.
    I am in revolt in most ways against the British
    Government myself. But politics are a fugitive
    thing in the face of history. Does anybody
    want to be fixed for ever on the wrong side at
    the Battle of Marathon, through a quarrel with
    some Archon whose very name is forgotten?
    Does anybody want to be remembered as a
    friend of Attila, through a breach of friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
    with Aëtius? In any case, it was with a profound
    conviction that if Prussia won Europe
    must perish, and that if Europe perished
    England and Ireland must perish together, that
    I went to Dublin in those dark days of the last
    year of the war; and it so happened that the
    first occasion when I was called upon for any
    expression of opinion was at a very pleasant
    luncheon party given to the representatives of
    the British Dominions, who were then on an
    official tour in the country inspecting its
    conditions. What I said is of no importance
    except as leading up to later events; but it may
    be noted that though I was speaking perhaps
    indirectly to Irishmen, I was speaking directly,
    if not to Englishmen, at least to men in the
    more English tradition of the majority of the
    Colonies. I was speaking, if not to Unionists,
    at least largely to Imperialists.
  </p>
  <p>Now I have forgotten, I am happy to say,
    the particular speech that I made, but I can
    repeat the upshot of it here, not only as part of
    the argument, but as part of the story. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
    line I took generally in Ireland was an appeal
    to the Irish principle, yet the reverse of a mere
    approval of the Irish action, or inaction. It
    postulated that while the English had missed
    a great opportunity of justifying themselves to
    the Irish, the Irish had also missed a similar
    opportunity of justifying themselves to the
    English. But it specially emphasised this;
    that what had been lost was not primarily a
    justification against England, but a joke
    against England. I pointed out that an Irishman
    missing a joke against an Englishman was
    a tragedy, like a lost battle. And there was one
    thing, and one thing only, which had stopped
    the Irishman from laughing and saved the
    Englishman from being laughable. The one
    and only thing that rescued England from
    ridicule was Sinn Fein. Or, at any rate, that
    element in Sinn Fein which was pro-German,
    or refused to be anti-German. Nothing imaginable
    under the stars <i>except</i> a pro-German Irishman
    could at that moment have saved the face
    of a (very recently) pro-German Englishman.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>The reason for this is obvious enough.
    England in 1914 encountered or discovered
    a colossal crime of Prussianised Germany. But
    England could not discover the German crime
    without discovering the English blunder. The
    blunder was, of course, a perfectly plain historical
    fact; that England made Prussia.
    England was the historic, highly civilised
    western state, with Roman foundations and
    chivalric memories; Prussia was originally a
    petty and boorish principality used by England
    and Austria in the long struggle against the
    greatness of France. Now in that long struggle
    Ireland had always been on the side of France.
    She had only to go on being on the side of
    France, and the Latin tradition generally, to
    behold her own truth triumph over her own
    enemies. In a word, it was not a question of
    whether Ireland should become anti-German,
    but merely of whether she should <i>continue</i> to
    be anti-German. It was a question of whether
    she should suddenly become pro-German, at
    the moment when most other pro-Germans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
    were discovering that she had been justified all
    along. But England, at the beginning of her
    last and most lamentable quarrel with Ireland,
    was by no means in so strong a controversial
    position. England was right; but she could
    only prove she was right by proving she was
    wrong. In one sense, and with all respect to
    her right action in the matter, she had to be
    ridiculous in order to be right.</p>
  <p>But the joke against the English was even
    more obvious and topical. And as mine was
    only meant for a light speech after a friendly
    lunch, I took the joke in its lightest and most
    fanciful form, and touched chiefly on the fantastic
    theory of the Teuton as the master of the
    Celt. For the supreme joke was this: that the
    Englishman has not only boasted of being an
    Englishman; he has actually boasted of being
    a German. As the modern mind began to
    doubt the superiority of Calvinism to Catholicism,
    all English books, papers, and speeches
    were filled more and more with a Teutonism
    which substituted a racial for a religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
    superiority. It was felt to be a more modern
    and even a more progressive principle of
    distinction, to insist on ethnology rather than
    theology; for ethnology was supposed to be
    a science. Unionism was simply founded
    on Teutonism. Hence the ordinary honest
    patriotic Unionist was in a highly humorous
    fix when he had suddenly to begin denouncing
    Teutonism as mere terrorism. If all superiority
    belonged to the Teuton, the supreme superiority
    must clearly belong to the most Teutonic
    Teuton. If I claim the right to kick Mr
    Bernard Shaw on the specific ground that I
    am fatter than he is, it is obvious that I look
    rather a fool if I am suddenly kicked by somebody
    who is fatter still. When the earth shakes
    under the advancing form of one coming
    against me out of the east who is fatter than I
    (for I called upon the Irish imagination to
    embrace so monstrous a vision), it is clear that
    whatever my relations to the rest of the world,
    in my relations to Mr Bernard Shaw I am rather
    at a disadvantage. Mr Shaw, at any rate, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
    rather in a position to make game of me; of
    which it is not inconceivable that he might
    avail himself. I might have accumulated a vast
    mass of learned sophistries and journalistic
    catchwords, which had always seemed to me to
    justify the connection between waxing fat and
    kicking. I might have proved from history
    that the leaders had always been fat men, like
    William the Conqueror, St Thomas Aquinas,
    and Charles Fox. I might have proved from
    physiology that fatness is a proof of the power
    of organic assimilation and digestion; or from
    comparative zoology that the elephant is the
    wisest of the beasts. In short, I might be able
    to adduce many arguments in favour of my
    position. Only, unfortunately, they would
    now all become arguments against my position.
    Everything I had ever urged against my old
    enemy could be urged much more forcibly
    against me by my new enemy. And my
    position touching the great adipose theory
    would be exactly like England’s position touching
    the equally sensible Teutonic theory. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
    Teutonism was creative culture, then on our
    own showing the German was better than the
    Englishman. If Teutonism was barbarism,
    then on our own showing the Englishman was
    more barbaric than the Irishman. The real
    answer, of course, is that we were not Teutons
    but only the dupes of Teutonism; but some
    were so wholly duped that they would do anything
    rather than own themselves dupes. These
    unfortunates, while they are already ashamed of
    being Teutons, are still proud of not being
    Celts.</p>
  <p>There is only one thing that could save my
    dignity in such an undignified fix as I have
    fancied here. It is that Mr Bernard Shaw
    himself should come to my rescue. It is that
    Mr Bernard Shaw himself should declare in
    favour of the corpulent conqueror from the
    east; that <i>he</i> should take seriously all the fads
    and fallacies of that fat-headed superman.
    That, and that alone, would ensure all my own
    fads and fallacies being not only forgotten but
    forgiven. There is present to my imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
    I regret to say, a wild possibility that this is
    what Mr Bernard Shaw might really do. Anyhow,
    this is what a certain number of his
    countrymen really did. It will be apparent,
    I think, from these pages that I do not believe
    in the stage Irishman. I am under no delusion
    that the Irishman is soft-headed and sentimental,
    or even illogical and inconsequent.
    Nine times out of ten the Irishman is not only
    more clear-headed, but even more cool-headed
    than the Englishman. But I think it is true,
    as Mr Max Beerbohm once suggested to me
    in connection with Mr Shaw himself, that there
    is a residual perversity in the Irishman, which
    comes after and not before the analysis of a
    question. There is at the last moment a cold
    impatience in the intellect, an irony which
    returns on itself and rends itself; the subtlety
    of a suicide. However this may be, some of
    the lean men, instead of making a fool of the
    fat man, did begin almost to make a hero of
    the fatter man; to admire his vast curves as
    almost cosmic lines of development. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
    seen Irish-American pamphlets which took
    quite seriously (or, I prefer to think, pretended
    to take quite seriously) the ridiculous romance
    about the Teutonic tribes having revived and
    refreshed civilisation after the fall of the
    Roman Empire. They revived civilisation
    very much as they restored Louvain or reconstructed
    the <i>Lusitania</i>. It was a romance which
    the English for a short time adopted as a
    convenience, but from which the Irish have
    continually suffered as from a curse. It was a
    suicidal perversity that they themselves, in
    their turn, should perpetuate their permanent
    curse as a temporary convenience. That was
    the worst error of the Irish, or of some of the
    best of the Irish. That is why the Easter
    Rising was really a black and insane blunder.
    It was not because it involved the Irish in a
    military defeat; it was because it lost the Irish
    a great controversial victory. The rebel
    deliberately let the tyrant out of a trap; out of
    the grinning jaws of the gigantic trap of a
    joke.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Many of the most extreme Nationalists knew
    this well; it was what Kettle probably meant
    when he suggested an Anglo-Irish history
    called ‘The Two Fools’; and of course I do
    not mean that I said all this in my very casual
    and rambling speech. But it was based on
    this idea, that men had missed the joke against
    England, and that now unfortunately the joke
    was rather against Ireland. It was Ireland that
    was now missing a great historical opportunity
    for lack of humour and imagination, as England
    had missed it a moment before. If the Irish
    would laugh at the English and help the
    English, they would win all along the line. In
    the real history of the German problem, they
    would inherit all the advantages of having been
    right from the first. It was now not so much
    a question of Ireland consenting to follow
    England’s lead as of England being obliged to
    follow Ireland’s lead. These are the principles
    which I thought, and still think, the only
    possible principles to form the basis of a
    recruiting appeal in Ireland. But on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
    particular occasion in question I naturally took
    the matter much more lightly, hoping that the
    two jokes might, as it were, cancel out and
    leave the two countries quits and in a better
    humour. And I devoted nearly all my remarks
    to testifying that the English had really, in the
    mass, shed the cruder Teutonism that had
    excused the cruelties of the past. I said that
    Englishmen were anything but proud of the
    past government of Ireland; that the mass of
    men of all parties were far more modest and
    humane in their view of Ireland than most
    Irishmen seem to suppose. And I ended with
    words which I only quote here from memory,
    because they happen to be the text of the
    curious incident which followed: ‘This is no
    place for us to boast. We stand here in the
    valley of our humiliation, where the flag we
    love has done very little that was not evil, and
    where its victories have been far more disastrous
    than defeats.’ And I concluded with
    some general expression of the hope (which
    I still entertain) that two lands so much loved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
    by those who know them best, are not meant
    to hate each other for ever.</p>
  <p>A day or two afterwards a distinguished
    historian who is a professor at Trinity College,
    Mr Alison Phillips, wrote an indignant letter
    to the <i>Irish Times</i>. He announced that he was
    not in the valley of humiliation, and warmly
    contradicted the report that he was, as he
    expressed it, ‘sitting in sackcloth and ashes.’
    He remarked, if I remember right, that I was
    middle-class, which is profoundly true; and
    he generally resented my suggestions as a
    shameful attack upon my fellow Englishmen.
    This both amused and puzzled me; for of
    course I had not been attacking Englishmen,
    but defending them; I had merely been assuring
    the Irish that the English were not so
    black, or so red, as they were painted in the
    vision of ‘England’s cruel red.’ I had not
    said there what I have said here, about the
    anomaly and absurdity of England in Ireland;
    I had only said that Ireland had suffered rather
    from the Teutonic theory than the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
    temper; and that the English temper, experienced
    at close quarters, was really quite ready
    for a reconciliation with Ireland. Nor indeed
    did Mr Alison Phillips really complain especially
    of my denouncing the English, but
    rather of my way of defending them. He did
    not so much mind being charged with the vice
    of arrogance. What he could not bear was
    being charged with the virtue of humility.
    What worried him was not so much the supposition
    of our doing wrong, as that anybody should
    conceive it possible that we were sorry for doing
    wrong. After all, he probably reasoned, it may
    not be easy for an eminent historical scholar
    actually to deny that certain tortures have taken
    place, or certain perjuries been proved; but
    there is really no reason why he should admit
    that the memory of using torture or perjury
    has so morbid an effect on the mind. Therefore
    he naturally desired to correct any impression
    that might arise, to the effect that he had
    been seen in the valley of humiliation, like a
    man called Christian.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>But there was one fancy that lingered in the
    mind over and above the fun of the thing; and
    threw a sort of random ray of conjecture upon
    all that long international misunderstanding
    which it is so hard to understand. Was it
    possible, I thought, that this had happened
    before, and that I was caught in the treadmill
    of recurrence? It may be that whenever,
    throughout the centuries, a roughly representative
    and fairly good-humoured Englishman has
    spoken to the Irish as thousands of such
    Englishmen feel about them, some other
    Englishman on the spot has hastened to explain
    that the English are not going in for sackcloth
    and ashes, but only for phylacteries and the
    blowing of their own trumpets before them.
    Perhaps whenever one Englishman said that
    the English were not so black as they were
    painted in the past, another Englishman always
    rushed forward to prove that the English were
    not so white as they were painted on the present
    occasion. And after all it was only Englishman
    against Englishman, one word against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
    another; and there were many superiorities on
    the side which refused to believe in English
    sympathy or self-criticism. And very few of
    the Irish, I fear, understood the simple fact of
    the matter, or the real spiritual excuses of the
    party thus praising spiritual pride. Few understood
    that I represented large numbers of
    amiable Englishmen in England, while Mr
    Phillips necessarily represented a small number
    of naturally irritable Englishmen in Ireland.
    Few, I fancy, sympathised with him so much
    as I do; for I know very well that he was not
    merely feeling as an Englishman, but as an
    exile.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">THE MISTAKE OF ENGLAND</h2>
  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">I met</span> one hearty Unionist, not to say Coercionist
    in Ireland, in such a manner as to talk to
    him at some length; one quite genial and
    genuine Irish gentleman, who was solidly on
    the side of the system of British government in
    Ireland. This gentleman had been shot
    through the body by the British troops in their
    efforts to suppress the Easter Rebellion. The
    matter just missed being tragic; but since it
    did, I cannot help feeling it as slightly comic.
    He assured me with great earnestness that the
    rebels had been guilty of the most calculated
    cruelties, and that they must have done their
    bloody deeds in the coldest blood. But since
    he is himself a solid and (I am happy to say) a
    living demonstration that the firing even on
    his own side must have been rather wild, I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
    inclined to give the benefit of the doubt also
    to the less elaborately educated marksmen.
    When disciplined troops destroy people so
    much at random, it would seem unreasonable
    to deny that rioters may possibly have been
    riotous. I hardly think he was, or even professed
    to be, a person of judicial impartiality;
    and it is entirely to his honour that he was, on
    principle, so much more indignant with the
    rioters who did not shoot him than with the
    other rioters who did. But I venture to introduce
    him here not so much as an individual
    as an allegory. The incident seems to me to
    set forth, in a pointed, lucid, and picturesque
    form, exactly what the British military government
    really succeeded in doing in Ireland. It
    succeeded in half-killing its friends, and
    affording an intelligent but somewhat inhumane
    amusement to all its enemies. The fire-eater
    held his fire-arm in so contorted a posture
    as to give the wondering spectator a simple
    impression of suicide.</p>
  <p>Let it be understood that I speak here, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
    of tyranny thwarting Irish desires, but solely
    of our own stupidity in thwarting our own
    desires. I shall discuss elsewhere the alleged
    presence or absence of practical oppression in
    Ireland; here I am only continuing from the
    last chapter my experiences of the recruiting
    campaign. I am concerned now, as I was
    concerned then, with the simple business
    matter of getting a big levy of soldiers from
    Ireland. I think it was Sir Francis Vane, one
    of the few really valuable public servants in the
    matter (I need not say he was dismissed for
    having been proved right) who said that the
    mere sight of some representative Belgian
    priests and nuns might have produced something
    like a crusade. The matter seems to
    have been mostly left to elderly English landlords;
    and it would be cruel to record their
    adventures. It will be enough that I heard, on
    excellent testimony, that these unhappy gentlemen
    had displayed throughout Ireland a poster
    consisting only of the Union Jack and the
    appeal, ‘Is not this your flag? Come and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
    fight for it!’ It faintly recalls something we
    all learnt in the Latin grammar about questions
    that expect the answer no. These remarkable
    recruiting-sergeants did not realise, I suppose,
    what an extraordinary thing this was, not
    merely in Irish opinion, but generally in
    international opinion. Over a great part of the
    globe, it would sound like a story that the Turks
    had placarded Armenia with the Crescent of
    Islam, and asked all the Christians who were
    not yet massacred whether they did not love
    the flag. I really do not believe that the Turks
    would be so stupid as to do it. Of course it
    may be said that such an impression or association
    is mere slander and sedition, that there is
    no reason to be tender to such treasonable
    emotions at all, that men ought to do their
    duty to that flag whatever is put upon that
    poster; in short, that it is the duty of an
    Irishman to be a patriotic Englishman, or
    whatever it is that he is expected to be. But
    this view, however logical and clear, can only
    be used logically and clearly as an argument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
    for conscription. It is simply muddle-headed
    to apply it to any appeal for volunteers anywhere,
    in Ireland or England. The whole
    object of a recruiting poster, or any poster, is
    to be attractive; it is picked out in words or
    colours to be picturesquely and pointedly
    attractive. If it lowers you to make an attractive
    offer, do not make it; but do not deliberately
    make it, and deliberately make it repulsive.
    If a certain medicine is so mortally necessary
    and so mortally nasty, that it must be forced
    on everybody by the policeman, call the
    policeman. But do not call an advertisement
    agent to push it like a patent medicine, solely
    by means of ‘publicity’ and ‘suggestion,’ and
    then confine him strictly to telling the public
    how nasty it is.</p>
  <p>But the British blunder in Ireland was a
    much deeper and more destructive thing. It
    can be summed up in one sentence; that
    whether or no we were as black as we were
    painted, we actually painted ourselves much
    blacker than we were. Bad as we were, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
    managed to look much worse than we were.
    In a horrible unconsciousness we re-enacted
    history through sheer ignorance of history.
    We were foolish enough to dress up, and to
    play up, to the part of a villain in a very old
    tragedy. We clothed ourselves almost carelessly
    in fire and sword; and if the fire had been
    literally stage-fire or the sword a wooden sword,
    the merely artistic blunder would have been
    quite as bad. For instance, I soon came on the
    traces of a quarrel about some silly veto in the
    schools, against Irish children wearing green
    rosettes. Anybody with a streak of historical
    imagination would have avoided a quarrel in
    that particular case about that particular colour.
    It is touching the talisman, it is naming the
    name, it is striking the note of another relation
    in which we were in the wrong, to the confusion
    of a new relation in which we were in the
    right. Anybody of common sense, considering
    any other case, can see the almost magic force
    of these material coincidences. If the English
    armies in France in 1914 considered themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
    justified for some reason in executing some
    Frenchwoman, they would perhaps be indiscreet
    if they killed her (however logically) tied
    to a stake in the market-place of Rouen. If
    the people of Paris rose in the most righteous
    revolt against the most corrupt conspiracy of
    some group of the wealthy French Protestants,
    I should strongly advise them not to fix the
    date for the vigil of St Bartholomew, or to go
    to work with white scarfs tied round their
    arms. Many of us hope to see a Jewish
    commonwealth reconstituted in Palestine; and
    we could easily imagine some quarrel in which
    the government of Jerusalem was impelled to
    punish some Greek or Latin pilgrim or monk.
    The Jews might even be right in the quarrel
    and the Christian wrong. But it may be
    hinted that the Jews would be ill-advised if
    they actually crowned him with thorns, and
    killed him on a hill just outside Jerusalem.
    Now we must know by this time, or the sooner
    we know it the better, that the whole mind of
    that European society which we have helped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
    to save, and in which we have henceforth a
    part right of control, regards the Anglo-Irish
    story as one of those black and white stories in
    a history book. It sees the tragedy of Ireland
    as simply and clearly as the tragedy of Christ
    or Joan of Arc. There may have been more to
    be said on the coercive side than the culture of
    the Continent understands. So there was a
    great deal more than is usually admitted to be
    said on the side of the patriotic democracy which
    condemned Socrates; and a very great deal
    to be said on the side of the imperial aristocracy
    which would have crushed Washington.
    But these disputes will not take Socrates from
    his niche among the pagan saints, or Washington
    from his pedestal among the republican
    heroes. After a certain testing time substantial
    justice is always done to the men who stood
    in some unmistakable manner for liberty and
    light against contemporary caprice and fashionable
    force and brutality. In this intellectual
    sense, in the only competent intellectual courts,
    there is already justice to Ireland. In the wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
    daylight of this world-wide fact we or our
    representatives must get into a quarrel with
    children, of all people, and about the colour
    green, of all things in the world. It is an
    exact working model of the mistake I mean.
    It is the more brutal because it is not strictly
    cruel; and yet instantly revives the memories
    of cruelty. There need be nothing wrong
    with it in the abstract, or in a less tragic
    atmosphere where the symbols were not
    talismans. A schoolmaster in the prosperous
    and enlightened town of Eatanswill might
    not unpardonably protest against the school-children
    parading in class the Buff and Blue
    favours of Mr Fizkin and Mr Slumkey.
    But who but a madman would not see that to
    say that word, or make that sign, in Ireland,
    was like giving a signal for keening and the
    lament over lost justice that is lifted in the
    burden of the noblest of national songs; that
    to point to that rag of that colour was to bring
    back all the responsibilities and realities of that
    reign of terror when we were, quite literally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
    hanging men and women too for wearing of
    the green? We were not literally hanging
    these children. As a matter of mere utility,
    we should have been more sensible if we had
    been.</p>
  <p>But the same fact took an even more fantastic
    form. We not only dressed up as our
    ancestors, but we actually dressed up as our
    enemies. I need hardly state my own conviction
    that the Pacifist trick of lumping the
    abuses of one side along with the abominations
    of the other was a shallow pedantry come of
    sheer ignorance of the history of Europe and
    the barbarians. It was quite false that the
    English evil was exactly the same as the
    German. It was quite false; but the English
    in Ireland laboured long and devotedly to
    prove it was quite true. They were not content
    with borrowing old uniforms from the
    Hessians of 1798; they borrowed the newest
    and neatest uniforms from the Prussians of
    1914. I will give only one story that I was
    told, out of many, to show what I mean. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
    was a sort of village musical festival at a place
    called Cullen in County Cork, at which there
    were naturally national songs and very possibly
    national speeches. That there was a sort of
    social atmosphere, which its critics would call
    Sinn Fein, is exceedingly likely; for that now
    exists all over Ireland, and especially that part
    of Ireland. If we wish to prevent it being
    expressed at all, we must not only forbid all
    public meetings but all private meetings, and
    even the meeting of husband and wife in their
    own house. Still there might have been a case,
    on coercionist lines, for forbidding this public
    meeting. There might be a case, on coercionist
    lines, for imprisoning all the people who
    attended it; or a still clearer case, on those lines,
    for imprisoning all the people in Ireland. But
    the coercionist authorities did not merely forbid
    the meeting, which would mean something.
    They did not arrest the people at the meeting,
    which would mean something. They did not
    blow the whole meeting to hell with big guns,
    which would also mean something. What they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
    did apparently was this. They caused a military
    aeroplane to jerk itself backwards and forwards
    in a staggering fashion just over the heads of
    the people, making as much noise as possible
    to drown the music, and dropping flare rockets
    and fire in various somewhat dangerous forms
    in the neighbourhood of any men, women, and
    children who happened to be listening to the
    music. The reader will note with what exquisite
    art, and fine fastidious selection, the
    strategist has here contrived to look as Prussian
    as possible without securing any of the advantages
    of Prussianism. I do not know exactly
    how much danger there was, but there must
    have been some. Perhaps about as much as
    there generally has been when boys have been
    flogged for playing the fool with fireworks. But
    by laboriously climbing hundreds of feet into
    the air, in an enormous military machine, these
    ingenuous people managed to make themselves
    a meteor in heaven and a spectacle to all
    the earth; the English raining fire on women
    and children just as the Germans did. I repeat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
    that they did not actually destroy children,
    though they did endanger them; for playing
    with fireworks is always playing with fire.
    And I repeat that, as a mere matter of business,
    it would have been more sensible if they had
    destroyed children. That would at least have
    had the human meaning that has run through
    a hundred massacres: ‘wolf-cubs who would
    grow into wolves.’ It might at least have the
    execrable excuse of decreasing the number of
    rebels. What they did would quite certainly
    increase it.</p>
  <p>An artless Member of Parliament, whose
    name I forget, attempted an apology for this
    half-witted performance. He interposed in the
    Unionist interests, when the Nationalists were
    asking questions about the matter, and said
    with much heat, ‘May I ask whether honest
    and loyal subjects have anything to fear from
    British aeroplanes?’ I have often wondered
    what he meant. It seems possible that he was
    in the mood of that mediæval fanatic who
    cried, ‘God will know his own’; and that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
    himself would fling any sort of flaming bolts
    about anywhere, believing that they would
    always be miraculously directed towards the
    heads harbouring, at that moment, the most
    incorrect political opinions. Or perhaps he
    meant that loyal subjects are so superbly loyal
    that they do not mind being accidentally burnt
    alive, so long as they are assured that the fire
    was dropped on them by Government officials
    out of a Government apparatus. But my purpose
    here is not to fathom such a mystery, but
    merely to fix the dominant fact of the whole
    situation; that the Government copied the
    theatricality of Potsdam even more than the
    tyranny of Potsdam. In that incident the
    English laboriously reproduced all the artificial
    accessories of the most notorious crimes of
    Germany; the flying men, the flame, the selection
    of a mixed crowd, the selection of a popular
    festival. They had every part of it, except the
    point of it. It was as if the whole British army
    in Ireland had dressed up in spiked helmets
    and spectacles, merely that they might <i>look</i> like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
    Prussians. It was even more as if a man had
    walked across Ireland on three gigantic stilts,
    taller than the trees and visible from the most
    distant village, solely that he might look like
    one of those unhuman monsters from Mars,
    striding about on their iron tripods in the great
    nightmare of Mr Wells. Such was our educational
    efficiency that, before the end, multitudes
    of simple Irish people really had about
    the English invasion the same particular psychological
    reaction that multitudes of simple
    English people had about the German invasion.
    I mean that it seemed to come not only from
    outside the nation, but from outside the
    world. It was unearthly in the strict sense in
    which a comet is unearthly. It was the more
    appallingly alien for coming close; it was the
    more outlandish the farther it went inland.
    These Christian peasants have seen coming
    westward out of England what we saw coming
    westward out of Germany. They saw science
    in arms; which turns the very heavens into
    hells.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>I have purposely put these fragmentary and
    secondary impressions before any general survey
    of Anglo-Irish policy in the war. I do so,
    first because I think a record of the real things,
    that seemed to bulk biggest to any real
    observer at any real moment, is often more
    useful than the setting forth of theories he may
    have made up before he saw any realities at
    all. But I do it in the second place because the
    more general summaries of our statesmanship,
    or lack of statesmanship, are so much more
    likely to be found elsewhere. But if we wish
    to comprehend the queer cross-purposes, it
    will be well to keep always in mind a historical
    fact I have mentioned already; the reality of
    the old Franco-Irish Entente. It lingers alive
    in Ireland, and especially the most Irish parts
    of Ireland. In the fiercely Fenian city of Cork,
    walking round the Young Ireland monument
    that seems to give revolt the majesty of an
    institution, a man told me that German bands
    had been hooted and pelted in those streets
    out of an indignant memory of 1870. And an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
    eminent scholar in the same town, referring
    to the events of the same ‘terrible year,’ said
    to me: ‘In 1870 Ireland sympathised with
    France and England with Germany; and, as
    usual, Ireland was right!’ But if they were
    right when we were wrong, they only began to
    be wrong when we were right. A sort of play
    or parable might be written to show that this
    apparent paradox is a very genuine piece of
    human psychology. Suppose there are two
    partners named John and James; that James
    has always been urging the establishment of a
    branch of the business in Paris. Long ago
    John quarrelled with this furiously as a foreign
    fad; but he has since forgotten all about it;
    for the letters from James bored him so much
    that he has not opened any of them for years.
    One fine day John, finding himself in Paris,
    conceives the original idea of a Paris branch;
    but he is conscious in a confused way of having
    quarrelled with his partner, and vaguely feels
    that his partner would be an obstacle to anything.
    John remembers that James was always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
    cantankerous, and forgets that he was cantankerous
    in favour of this project, and not
    against it. John therefore sends James a telegram,
    of a brevity amounting to brutality,
    simply telling him to come in with no nonsense
    about it; and when he has no instant reply,
    sends a solicitor’s letter to be followed by a
    writ. How James will take it depends very
    much on James. How he will hail this happy
    confirmation of his own early opinions will
    depend on whether James is an unusually
    patient and charitable person. And James is
    not. He is unfortunately the very man, of all
    men in the world, to drop his own original
    agreement and everything else into the black
    abyss of disdain, which now divides him from
    the man who has the impudence to agree with
    him. He is the very man to say he will have
    nothing to do with his own original notion,
    because it is now the belated notion of a fool.
    Such a character could easily be analysed in
    any good novel. Such conduct would readily
    be believed in any good play. It could not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
    believed when it happened in real life. And
    it did happen in real life; the Paris project was
    the sense of the safety of Paris as the pivot
    of human history; the abrupt telegram was
    the recruiting campaign, and the writ was
    conscription.</p>
  <p>As to what Irish conscription was, or rather
    would have been, I cannot understand any
    visitor in Ireland having the faintest doubt,
    unless (as is often the case) his tour was so
    carefully planned as to permit him to visit
    everything in Ireland except the Irish. Irish
    conscription was a piece of rank raving madness,
    which was fortunately stopped, with other bad
    things, by the blow of Foch at the second
    battle of the Marne. It could not possibly
    produce at the last moment allies on whom we
    could depend; and it would have lost us the
    whole sympathy of the allies on whom we at
    that moment depended. I do not mean that
    American soldiers would have mutinied;
    though Irish soldiers might have done so; I
    mean something much worse. I mean that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
    whole mood of America would have altered;
    and there would have been some kind of compromise
    with German tyranny, in sheer disgust
    at a long exhibition of English tyranny. Things
    would have happened in Ireland, week after
    week, and month after month, such as the
    modern imagination has not seen except where
    Prussia has established hell. We should have
    butchered women and children; they would
    have <i>made us</i> butcher them. We should have
    killed priests, and probably the best priests.
    It could not be better stated than in the words
    of an Irishman, as he stood with me in a high
    terraced garden outside Dublin, looking towards
    that unhappy city, who shook his head
    and said sadly, ‘They will shoot the wrong
    bishop.’</p>
  <p>Of the meaning of this huge furnace of defiance
    I shall write when I write of the national
    idea itself. I am concerned here not for their
    nation but for mine; and especially for its
    peril from Prussia and its help from America.
    And it is simply a question of considering what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
    these real things are really like. Remember
    that the American Republic is practically
    founded on the fact, or fancy, that England is
    a tyrant. Remember that it was being ceaselessly
    swept with new waves of immigrant
    Irishry telling tales (too many of them true,
    though not all) of the particular cases in which
    England had been a tyrant. It would be hard
    to find a parallel to explain to Englishmen the
    effect of awakening traditions so truly American
    by a prolonged display of England as the
    tyrant in Ireland. A faint approximation might
    be found if we imagined the survivors of
    Victorian England, steeped in the tradition of
    <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, watching the American
    troops march through London. Suppose they
    noted that the negro troops alone had to march
    in chains, with a white man in a broad-brimmed
    hat walking beside them and flourishing a whip.
    Scenes far worse than that would have followed
    Irish conscription; but the only purpose of
    this chapter is to show that scenes quite as
    stupid marked every stage of Irish recruitment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
    For it certainly would not have reassured the
    traditional sympathisers with Uncle Tom to
    be told that the chains were only a part of the
    uniform, or that the niggers moved not at the
    touch of the whip, but only at the crack of it.
  </p>
  <p>Such was our practical policy; and the single
    and sufficient comment on it can be found in
    a horrible whisper which can scarcely now be
    stilled. It is said, with a dreadful plausibility,
    that the Unionists were deliberately trying to
    prevent a large Irish recruitment, which would
    certainly have meant reconciliation and reform.
    In plain words, it is said that they were willing
    to be traitors to England, if they could only
    still be tyrants to Ireland. Only too many
    facts can be made to fit in with this; but for
    me it is still too hideous to be easily believed.
    But whatever our motives in doing it, there is
    simply no doubt whatever about what we did,
    in this matter of the Pro-Germans in Ireland.
    We did not crush the Pro-Germans; we did
    not convert them, or coerce them, or educate
    them or exterminate them or massacre them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
    We manufactured them; we turned them out
    patiently, steadily, and systematically as if from
    a factory; we made them exactly as we made
    munitions. It needed no little social science
    to produce, in any kind of Irishman, any kind
    of sympathy with Prussia; but we were equal
    to the task. What concerns me here, however,
    is that we were busy at the same work
    among the Irish-Americans, and ultimately
    among all the Americans. And that would
    have meant, as I have already noted, the thing
    that I always feared; the dilution of the policy
    of the Allies. Anything that looked like a prolonged
    Prussianism in Ireland would have
    meant a compromise; that is, a perpetuated
    Prussianism in Europe. I know that some
    who agree with me in other matters disagree
    with me in this; but I should indeed be ashamed
    if, having to say so often where I think my
    country was wrong, I did not say as plainly
    where I think she was right. The notion of
    a compromise was founded on the coincidence
    of recent national wars, which were only about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
    the terms of peace, not about the type of
    civilisation. But there do recur, at longer
    historic intervals, universal wars of religion,
    not concerned with what one nation shall do,
    but with what all nations shall be. They
    recommence until they are finished, in things
    like the fall of Carthage or the rout of Attila.
    It is quite true that history is for the most part
    a plain road, which the tribes of men must
    travel side by side, bargaining at the same
    markets or worshipping at the same shrines,
    fighting and making friends again; and wisely
    making friends quickly. But we need only
    see the road stretch but a little farther, from a
    hill but a little higher, to see that sooner or
    later the road comes always to another place,
    where stands a winged image of victory; and
    the ways divide.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">THE MISTAKE OF IRELAND</h2>
  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one phrase which certain Irishmen
    sometimes use in conversation, which indicates
    the real mistake that they sometimes make in
    controversy. When the more bitter sort of
    Irishman is at last convinced of the existence
    of the less bitter sort of Englishman, who does
    realise that he ought not to rule a Christian
    people by alternations of broken heads and
    broken promises, the Irishman has sometimes
    a way of saying, ‘I am sure you must have
    Irish blood in your veins.’ Several people told
    me so when I denounced Irish conscription,
    a thing ruinous to the whole cause of the
    Alliance. Some told me so even when I recalled
    the vile story of ’98; a thing damned by
    the whole opinion of the world. I assured them
    in vain that I did not need to have Irish blood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
    in my veins, in order to object to having Irish
    blood on my hands. So far as I know, I have
    not one single drop of Irish blood in my veins.
    I have some Scottish blood; and some which,
    judging merely by a name in the family, must
    once have been French blood. But the
    determining part of it is purely English, and
    I believe East Anglian, at the flattest and
    farthest extreme from the Celtic fringe. But
    I am here concerned, not with whether it is true,
    but with why they should want to prove it is
    true. One would think they would want to
    prove precisely the opposite. Even if they were
    exaggerative and unscrupulous, they should
    surely seek to show that an Englishman was
    forced to condemn England, rather than that
    an Irishman was inclined to support Ireland.
    As it is, they are labouring to destroy the
    impartiality and even the independence of their
    own witness. It does not support, but rather
    surrender Irish rights, to say that only the
    Irish can see that there are Irish wrongs. It
    is confessing that Ireland is a Celtic dream and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
    delusion, a cloud of sunset mistaken for an
    island. It is admitting that such a nation is
    only a notion, and a nonsensical notion; but
    in reality it is this notion about Irish blood
    that is nonsensical. Ireland is not an illusion;
    and her wrongs are not the subjective fancies
    of the Irish. Irishmen did not dream that they
    were evicted out of house and home by the
    ruthless application of a land law no man now
    dares to defend. It was not a nightmare that
    dragged them from their beds; nor were they
    sleepwalkers when they wandered as far as
    America. Skeffington did not have a delusion
    that he was being shot for keeping the peace;
    the shooting was objective, as the Prussian
    professors would say; as objective as the
    Prussian militarists could desire. The delusions
    were admittedly peculiar to the British official
    whom the British Government selected to
    direct operations on so important an occasion.
    I could understand it if the Imperialists took
    refuge in the Celtic cloud, conceived Colthurst
    as full of a mystic frenzy like the chieftain who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
    fought with the sea, pleaded that Piggott was
    a poet whose pen ran away with him, or that
    Sergeant Sheridan romanced like a real stage
    Irishman. I could understand it if they declared
    that it was merely in the elvish ecstasy
    described by Mr Yeats that Sir Edward
    Carson, that famous First Lord of the Admiralty,
    rode on the top of the dishevelled wave; and
    Mr Walter Long, that great Agricultural
    Minister, danced upon the mountains like a
    flame. It is far more absurd to suggest that
    no man can see the green flag unless he has
    some green in his eye. In truth this association
    between an Irish sympathy and an Irish ancestry
    is just as insulting as the old jibe of
    Buckingham, about an Irish interest or an
    Irish understanding.</p>
  <p>It may seem fanciful to say of the Irish
    nationalists that they are sometimes too Irish
    to be national. Yet this is really the case in
    those who would turn nationality from a
    sanctity to a secret. That is, they are turning
    it from something which every one else ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
    to respect, to something which no one else can
    understand. Nationalism is a nobler thing
    even than patriotism; for nationalism appeals
    to a law of nations; it implies that a nation is
    a normal thing, and therefore one of a number
    of normal things. It is impossible to have a
    nation without Christendom; as it is impossible
    to have a citizen without a city. Now normally
    speaking this is better understood in Ireland
    than in England; but the Irish have an
    opposite exaggeration and error, and tend in
    some cases to the cult of real insularity. In
    this sense it is true to say that the error is
    indicated in the very name of Sinn Fein. But
    I think it is even more encouraged, in a cloudier
    and therefore more perilous fashion, by much
    that is otherwise valuable in the cult of the
    Celts and the study of the old Irish language.
    It is a great mistake for a man to defend himself
    as a Celt when he might defend himself
    as an Irishman. For the former defence will
    turn on some tricky question of temperament,
    while the latter will turn on the central pivot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
    morals. Celticism, by itself, might lead to all
    the racial extravagances which have lately led
    more barbaric races a dance. Celts also might
    come to claim, not that their nation is a normal
    thing, but that their race is a unique thing.
    Celts also might end by arguing not for an
    equality founded on the respect for boundaries,
    but for an aristocracy founded on the ramification
    of blood. Celts also might come to pitting
    the prehistoric against the historic, the heathen
    against the Christian, and in that sense the
    barbaric against the civilised. In that sense
    I confess I do not care about Celts; they
    are too like Teutons.</p>
  <p>Now of course every one knows that there
    is practically no such danger of Celtic Imperialism.
    Mr Lloyd George will not attempt to
    annex Brittany as a natural part of Britain.
    No Tories, however antiquated, will extend
    their empire in the name of the True Blue
    of the Ancient Britons. Nor is there the least
    likelihood that the Irish will overrun Scotland
    on the plea of an Irish origin for the old name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
    of the Scots; or that they will set up an Irish
    capital at Stratford-on-Avon merely because
    <i>avon</i> is the Celtic word for water. That is the
    sort of thing that Teutonic ethnologists do;
    but Celts are not quite so stupid as that, even
    when they are ethnologists. It may be
    suggested that this is because even prehistoric
    Celts seem to have been rather more civilised
    than historic Teutons. And indeed I have
    seen ornaments and utensils in the admirable
    Dublin museum, suggestive of a society of
    immense antiquity, and much more advanced
    in the arts of life than the Prussians were, only
    a few centuries ago. For instance, there was
    something that looked like a sort of safety razor.
    I doubt if the godlike Goths had much use for
    a razor; or if they had, if it was altogether safe.
    Nor am I so dull as not to be stirred to an
    imaginative sympathy with the instinct of
    modern Irish poetry to praise this primordial
    and mysterious order, even as a sort of pagan
    paradise; and that not as regarding a legend
    as a sort of lie, but a tradition as a sort of truth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
    It is but another hint of a suggestion, huge
    yet hidden, that civilisation is older than barbarism;
    and that the farther we go back into
    pagan origins, the nearer we come to the great
    Christian origin of the Fall. But whatever
    credit or sympathy be due to the cult of Celtic
    origins in its proper place, it is none of these
    things that really prevents Celticism from being
    a barbarous imperialism like Teutonism. The
    thing that prevents imperialism is nationalism.
    It was exactly because Germany was not a
    nation that it desired more and more to be an
    empire. For a patriot is a sort of lover, and
    a lover is a sort of artist; and the artist will
    always love a shape too much to wish it to grow
    shapeless, even in order to grow large. A
    group of Teutonic tribes will not care how many
    other tribes they destroy or absorb; and Celtic
    tribes when they were heathen may have acted,
    for all I know, in the same way. But the
    civilised Irish nation, a part and product of
    Christendom, has certainly no desire to be
    entangled with other tribes, or to have its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
    outlines blurred with great blots like Liverpool
    and Glasgow, as well as Belfast. In that sense
    it is far too self-conscious to be selfish. Its
    individuality may, as I shall suggest, make it
    too insular; it will not make it too imperial.
    This is a merit in nationalism too little noted;
    that even what is called its narrowness is not
    merely a barrier to invasion, but a barrier to
    expansion. Therefore, with all respect to the
    prehistoric Celts, I feel more at home with
    the good if sometimes mad Christian gentlemen
    of the Young Ireland movement, or even
    the Easter Rebellion. I should feel more safe
    with Meagher of the Sword than with the
    primitive Celt of the safety razor. The microscopic
    meanness of the Mid-Victorian English
    writers, when they wrote about Irish patriots,
    could see nothing but a very small joke in
    modern rebels thinking themselves worthy to
    take the titles of antique kings. But the only
    doubt I should have, if I had any, is whether
    the heathen kings were worthy of the Christian
    rebels. I am much more sure of the heroism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
    of the modern Fenians than of the ancient
    ones.
  </p>
  <p>Of the artistic side of the cult of the Celts
    I do not especially speak here. And indeed
    its importance, especially to the Irish, may
    easily be exaggerated. Mr W. B. Yeats long ago
    dissociated himself from a merely racial theory
    of Irish poetry; and Mr W. B. Yeats thinks as
    hard as he talks. I often entirely disagree with
    him; but I disagree far more with the people
    who find him a poetical opiate, where I always
    find him a logical stimulant. For the rest,
    Celticism in some aspects is largely a conspiracy
    for leading the Englishman a dance, if
    it be a fairy dance. I suspect that many names
    and announcements are printed in Gaelic, not
    because Irishmen can read them, but because
    Englishmen can’t. The other great modern
    mystic in Dublin, entertained us first by
    telling an English lady present that she
    would never resist the Celtic atmosphere,
    struggle how she might, but would soon be
    wandering in the mountain mists with a fillet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
    round her head; which fate had apparently
    overtaken the son or nephew of an Anglican
    bishop who had strayed into those parts. The
    English lady, whom I happen to know rather
    well, made the characteristic announcement
    that she would go to Paris when she felt it
    coming on. But it seemed to me that such
    drastic action was hardly necessary, and that
    there was comparatively little cause for alarm;
    seeing that the mountain mists certainly had
    not had that effect on the people who happen
    to live in the mountains. I knew that the
    poet knew, even better than I did, that Irish
    peasants do not wander about in fillets, or indeed
    wander about at all, having plenty of much
    better work to do. And since the Celtic
    atmosphere had no perceptible effect on the
    Celts, I felt no alarm about its effect on the
    Saxons. But the only thing involved, by way
    of an effect on the Saxons, was a practical joke
    on the Saxons; which may, however, have lasted
    longer in the case of the bishop’s son than
    it did in mine. Anyhow, I continued to move<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
    about (like Atalanta in Calydon) with unchapleted
    hair, with unfilleted cheek; and
    found a sufficient number of Irish people in the
    same condition to prevent me from feeling shy.
    In a word, all that sort of thing is simply the
    poet’s humour, especially his good humour,
    which is of a golden and godlike sort. And a
    man would be very much misled by the practical
    joke if he does not realise that the joker is
    a practical man. On the desk in front of him as
    he spoke were business papers of reports and
    statistics, much more concerned with fillets of
    veal than fillets of vision. That is the essential
    fact about all this side of such men in Ireland.
    We may think the Celtic ghost a turnip ghost;
    but we can only doubt the reality of the
    ghost; there is no doubt of the reality of the
    turnip.</p>
  <p>But if the Celtic pose be a piece of the Celtic
    ornament, the spirit that produced it does also
    produce some more serious tendencies to the
    segregation of Ireland, one might almost say
    the secretion of Ireland. In this sense it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
    true that there is too much separatism in
    Ireland. I do not speak of separation from
    England, which, as I have said, happened
    long ago in the only serious sense, and is a
    condition to be assumed, not a conclusion to be
    avoided. Nor do I mean separation from some
    federation of free states including England;
    for that is a conclusion that could still be
    avoided with a little common sense and common
    honesty in our own politics. I mean separation
    from Europe, from the common Christian
    civilisation by whose law the nations live. I
    would be understood as speaking here of
    exceptions rather than the rule; for the rule is
    rather the other way. The Catholic religion,
    the most fundamental fact in Ireland, is itself
    a permanent communication with the Continent.
    So, as I have said, is the free peasantry
    which is so often the economic expression of
    the same faith. Mr James Stephens, himself
    a spiritually detached man of genius, told me
    with great humour a story which is also at
    least a symbol. A Catholic priest, after a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
    convivial conversation and plenty of good wine,
    said to him confidentially: “You ought to be
    a Catholic. You can be saved without being
    a Catholic; but you can’t be Irish without
    being a Catholic.”</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the exceptions are large enough
    to be dangers; and twice lately, I think, they
    have brought Ireland into danger. This is the
    age of minorities; of groups that rule rather
    than represent. And the two largest parties
    in Ireland, though more representative than
    most parties in England, were too much
    affected, I fancy, by the modern fashion,
    expressed in the world of fads by being Celtic
    rather than Catholic. They were just a little
    too insular to accept the old unconscious wave
    of Christendom; the Crusade. But the case
    was more extraordinary than that. They were
    even too insular to appreciate, not so much
    their own international needs, as their own
    international importance. It may seem a
    strange paradox to say that both nationalist
    parties underrated Ireland as a nation. It may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
    seem a more startling paradox to say that in
    this the most nationalist was the least national.
    Yet I think I can explain, however roughly,
    what I mean by saying that this is so.</p>
  <p>It is primarily Sinn Fein, or the extreme
    national party, which thus relatively failed to
    realise that Ireland is a nation. At least it
    failed in nationalism exactly so far as it failed
    to intervene in the war of the nations against
    Prussian imperialism. For its argument
    involved, unconsciously, the proposition that
    Ireland is not a nation; that Ireland is a tribe
    or a settlement, or a chance sprinkling of
    aborigines. If the Irish were savages oppressed
    by the British Empire, they might well be
    indifferent to the fate of the British Empire;
    but as they were civilised men, they could not
    be indifferent to the fate of civilisation. The
    Kaffirs might conceivably be better off if the
    whole system of white colonisation, Boer and
    British, broke down and disappeared altogether.
    The Irish might sympathise with the Kaffirs,
    but they would not like to be classed with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
    Kaffirs. Hottentots might have a sort of
    Hottentot happiness if the last European city
    had fallen in ruins, or the last European had
    died in torments. But the Irish would never
    be Hottentots, even if they were pro-Hottentots.
    In other words, if the Irish were what
    Cromwell thought they were, they might well
    confine their attention to Hell and Connaught,
    and have no sympathy to spare for France.
    But if the Irish are what Wolfe Tone thought
    they were, they must be interested in France,
    as he was interested in France. In short, if
    the Irish are barbarians, they need not trouble
    about other barbarians sacking the cities of the
    world; but if they are citizens, they must
    trouble about the cities that are sacked. This
    is the deep and real reason why their alienation
    from the Allied cause was a disaster for their
    own national cause. It was not because it gave
    fools a chance of complaining that they were
    anti-English, it was because it gave much
    cleverer people the chance of complaining that
    they were anti-European. I entirely agree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
    that the alienation was chiefly the fault of the
    English Government; I even agree that it
    required an abnormal imaginative magnanimity
    for an Irishman to do his duty to Ireland, in
    spite of being so insolently told to do it. But
    it is none the less true that Ireland to-day
    would be ten thousand miles nearer her deliverance
    if the Irishman could have made that
    effort; if he had realised that the thing ought
    to be done, not because such rulers wanted it,
    but rather although they wanted it.</p>
  <p>But the much more curious fact is this.
    There were any number of Irishmen, and those
    among the most Irish, who did realise this;
    who realised it with so sublime a sincerity as to
    fight for their own enemies against the world’s
    enemies, and consent at once to be insulted by
    the English and killed by the Germans. The
    Redmonds and the old Nationalist party, if
    they have indeed failed, have the right to be
    reckoned among the most heroic of all the heroic
    failures of Ireland. If theirs is a lost cause,
    it is wholly worthy of a land where lost causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
    are never lost. But the old guard of Redmond
    did also in its time, I fancy, fall into the same
    particular and curious error, but in a more
    subtle way and on a seemingly remote subject.
    They also, whose motives like those of the Sinn
    Feiners were entirely noble, did in one sense
    fail to be national, in the sense of appreciating
    the international importance of a nation. In
    their case it was a matter of English and not
    European politics; and as their case was much
    more complicated, I speak with much less
    confidence about it. But I think there was a
    highly determining time in politics when
    certain Irishmen got on to the wrong side in
    English politics, as other Irishmen afterwards
    got on to the wrong side in European politics.
    And by the wrong side, in both cases, I not
    only mean the side that was not consistent with
    the truth, but the side that was not really congenial
    to the Irish. A man may act against
    the body, even the main body, of his nation;
    but if he acts against the soul of his nation,
    even to save it, he and his nation suffer.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>I can best explain what I mean by reaffirming
    the reality which an English visitor really
    found in Irish politics, towards the end of the
    war. It may seem odd to say that the most
    hopeful fact I found, for Anglo-Irish relations,
    was the fury with which the Irish were all
    accusing the English of perjury and treason.
    Yet this was my solid and sincere impression;
    the happiest omen was the hatred aroused by
    the disappointment over Home Rule. For
    men are not furious unless they are disappointed
    of something they really want; and men are not
    disappointed except about something they were
    really ready to accept. If Ireland had been
    entirely in favour of entire separation, the loss
    of Home Rule would not be felt as a loss, but
    if anything as an escape. But it is felt bitterly
    and savagely as a loss; to that at least I can
    testify with entire certainty. I may or may not
    be right in the belief I build on it; but I
    believe it would still be felt as a gain; that
    Dominion Home Rule would in the long run
    satisfy Ireland. But it would satisfy her if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
    were given to her, not if it were promised to
    her. As it is, the Irish regard our Government
    simply as a liar who has broken his word; I
    cannot express how big and black that simple
    idea bulks in the landscape and blocks up the
    road. And without professing to regard it as
    quite so simple, I regard it as substantially
    true. It is, upon any argument, an astounding
    thing the King, Lords, and Commons of a
    great nation should record on its statute-book
    that a law exists, and then illegally reverse it
    in answer to the pressure of private persons.
    It is, and must be, for the people benefited by
    the law, an act of treason. The Irish were not
    wrong in thinking it an act of treason, even in
    the sense of treachery and trickery. Where
    they were wrong, I regret to say, was in talking
    of it as if it were the one supreme solitary
    example of such trickery; when the whole of
    our politics were full of such tricks. In short,
    the loss of justice for Ireland was simply a part
    of the loss of justice in England; the loss of all
    moral authority in government, the loss of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
    popularity of Parliament, the secret plutocracy
    which makes it easy to take a bribe or break a
    pledge, the corruption that can pass unpopular
    laws or promote discredited men. The law-giver
    cannot enforce his law because, whether
    or no the law be popular, the law-giver is wholly
    unpopular, and is perpetually passing wholly
    unpopular laws. Intrigue has been substituted
    for government; and the public man cannot
    appeal to the public because all the most
    important part of his policy is conducted in
    private. The modern politician conducts his
    public life in private. He sometimes condescends
    to make up for it by affecting to conduct
    his private life in public. He will put his baby
    or his birthday book into the illustrated papers;
    it is his dealings with the colossal millions of the
    cosmopolitan millionaires that he puts in his
    pocket or his private safe. We are allowed to
    know all about his dogs and cats; but not
    about those larger and more dangerous animals,
    his bulls and bears.</p>
  <p>Now there was a moment when England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
    had an opportunity of breaking down this
    parliamentary evil, as Europe afterwards had
    an opportunity (which it fortunately took) of
    breaking down the Prussian evil. The corruption
    was common to both parties; but the
    chance of exposing it happened to occur under
    the rule of a Home Rule party; which the
    Nationalists supported solely for the sake of
    Home Rule. In the Marconi Case they consented
    to whitewash the tricks of Jew jobbers
    whom they must have despised, just as some
    of the Sinn Feiners afterwards consented to
    whitewash the wickedness of Prussian bullies
    whom they also must have despised. In both
    cases the motive was wholly disinterested and
    even idealistic. It was the practicality that was
    unpractical. I was one of a small group which
    protested against the hushing up of the Marconi
    affair, but we always did justice to the patriotic
    intentions of the Irish who allowed it. But we
    based our criticism of their strategy on the
    principle of <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i>. The
    man who will cheat you about one thing will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
    cheat you about another. The men who will
    lie to you about Marconi, will lie to you about
    Home Rule. The political conventions that
    allow of dealing in Marconis at one price for
    the party, and another price for oneself, are
    conventions that also allow of telling one story
    to Mr John Redmond and another to Sir
    Edward Carson. The man who will imply one
    state of things when talking at large in
    Parliament, and another state of things when
    put into a witness-box in court, is the same
    sort of man who will promise an Irish settlement
    in the hope that it may fail; and then
    withdraw it for fear it should succeed. Among
    the many muddle-headed modern attempts
    to coerce the Christian poor to the Moslem
    dogma about wine and beer, one was concerned
    with abuse by loafers or tipplers of
    the privilege of the Sunday traveller. It was
    suggested that the travellers’ claims were in
    every sense travellers’ tales. It was therefore
    proposed that the limit of three miles should
    be extended to six; as if it were any harder for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
    a liar to say he had walked six miles than three.
    The politicians might be as ready to promise
    to walk the six miles to an Irish Republic as the
    three miles to an Irish Parliament. But Sinn
    Fein is mistaken in supposing that any change
    of theoretic claim meets the problem of corruption.
    Those who would break their word to
    Redmond would certainly break it to De
    Valera. We urged all these things on the
    Nationalists whose national cause we supported;
    we asked them to follow their larger popular
    instincts, break down a corrupt oligarchy, and
    let a real popular parliament in England give
    a real popular parliament to Ireland. With
    entirely honourable motives, they adhered to
    the narrower conception of their national duty.
    They sacrificed everything for Home Rule,
    even their own profoundly national emotion of
    contempt. For the sake of Home Rule, or the
    solemn promise of Home Rule, they kept such
    men in power; and for their reward they found
    that such men were still in power; and Home
    Rule was gone.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>What I mean about the Nationalist Party,
    and what may be called its prophetic shadow of
    the Sinn Fein mistake, may well be symbolised
    in one of the noblest figures of that party or any
    party. An Irish poet, talking to me about the
    pointed diction of the Irish peasant, said he had
    recently rejoiced in the society of a drunken
    Kerry farmer, whose conversation was a litany
    of questions about everything in heaven and
    earth, each ending with a sort of chorus of
    ‘Will ye tell me that now?’ And at the end
    of all he said abruptly, ‘Did ye know Tom
    Kettle?’ and on my friend the poet assenting,
    the farmer said, as if in triumph, ‘And why
    are so many people alive that ought to be dead,
    and so many people dead that ought to be
    alive? Will ye tell me that now?’ That is
    not unworthy of an old heroic poem, and therefore
    not unworthy of the hero and poet of whom
    it was spoken. ‘Patroclus died, who was a
    better man than you.’ Thomas Michael
    Kettle was perhaps the greatest example of
    that greatness of spirit which was so ill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
    rewarded on both sides of the channel and of
    the quarrel, which marked Redmond’s brother
    and so many of Redmond’s followers. He was a
    wit, a scholar, an orator, a man ambitious in all
    the arts of peace; and he fell fighting the
    barbarians because he was too good a European
    to use the barbarians against England, as
    England a hundred years before had used the
    barbarians against Ireland. There is nothing
    to be said of such things except what the
    drunken farmer said, unless it be a verse from
    a familiar ballad on a very remote topic, which
    happens to express my own most immediate
    feelings about politics and reconstruction after
    the decimation of the great war.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is not a reflection that adds any inordinate
    self-satisfaction to the fact of one’s own survival.</p>
  <p>In turning over a collection of Kettle’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
    extraordinary varied and vigorous writings,
    which contain some of the most pointed and
    piercing criticisms of materialism, of modern
    capitalism and mental and moral anarchism
    generally, I came on a very interesting criticism
    of myself and my friends in our Marconi
    agitation; a suggestion, on a note of genial
    cynicism, that we were asking for an impossible
    political purity; a suggestion which, knowing
    it to be patriotic, I will venture to call pathetic.
    I will not now return on such disagreements
    with a man with whom I so universally agree;
    but it will not be unfair to find here an exact
    illustration of what I mean by saying that the
    national leaders, so far from merely failing as
    wild Irishmen, only failed when they were not
    instinctive enough, that is, not Irish enough.
    Kettle was a patriot whose impulse was practical,
    and whose policy was impolitic. Here also
    the Nationalist underrated the importance of
    the intervention of his own nationality. Kettle
    left a fine and even terrible poem, asking if his
    sacrifices were in vain, and whether he and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
    people were again being betrayed. I think
    nobody can deny that he was betrayed; but it
    was not by the English soldiers with whom he
    marched to war, but by those very English
    politicians with whom he sacrificed so much to
    remain at peace. No man will ever dare to say
    his death in battle was in vain, not only because
    in the highest sense it could never be, but
    because even in the lowest sense it was not.
    He hated the icy insolence of Prussia; and
    that ice is broken, and already as weak as water.
    As Carlyle said of a far lesser thing, that at
    least will never through unending ages insult
    the face of the sun any more. The point is
    here that if any part of his fine work was in
    vain, it was certainly not the reckless romantic
    part; it was precisely the plodding parliamentary
    part. None can say that the weary marching
    and counter-marching in France was a
    thing thrown away; not only in the sense which
    consecrates all footprints along such a <i>via
      crucis</i>, or highway of the army of martyrs; but
    also in the perfectly practical sense, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
    army was going somewhere, and that it got
    there. But it might possibly be said that the
    weary marching and counter-marching at Westminster,
    in and out of a division lobby, belonged
    to what the French call the <i>salle des pas perdus</i>.
    If anything was practical it was the visionary
    adventure; if anything was unpractical it was
    the practical compromise. He and his friends
    were betrayed by the men whose corruptions
    they had contemptuously condoned, far more
    than by the men whose bigotries they had
    indignantly denounced. There darkened about
    them treason and disappointment, and he that
    was the happiest died in battle; and one who
    knew and loved him spoke to me for a million
    others in saying: ‘And now we will not give
    you a dead dog until you keep your word.’</p>

  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">We</span> all had occasion to rejoice at the return of
    Sherlock Holmes when he was supposed to be
    dead; and I presume we may soon rejoice in
    his return even when he is really dead. Sir
    Arthur Conan Doyle, in his widespread new
    campaign in favour of Spiritualism, ought at
    least to delight us with the comedy of Holmes
    as a control and Watson as a medium. But I
    have for the moment a use for the great
    detective not concerned with the psychical side
    of the question. Of that I will only say, in
    passing, that in this as in many other cases,
    I find myself in agreement with an authority
    about where the line is drawn between good
    and bad, but have the misfortune to think his
    good bad, and his bad good. Sir Arthur
    explains that he would lift Spiritualism to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
    graver and more elevated plane of idealism;
    and that he quite agrees with his critics that the
    mere tricks with tables and chairs are grotesque
    and vulgar. I think this quite true if turned
    upside down, like the table. I do not mind the
    grotesque and vulgar part of Spiritualism;
    what I object to is the grave and elevating part.
    After all, a miracle is a miracle and means
    something; it means that Materialism is nonsense.
    But it is not true that a message is
    always a message; and it sometimes only means
    that Spiritualism is also nonsense. If the table
    at which I am now writing takes to itself wings
    and flies out of the window, perhaps carrying
    me along with it, the incident will arouse in me
    a real intelligent interest, verging on surprise.
    But if the pen with which I am writing begins
    to scrawl, all by itself, the sort of things I have
    seen in spirit writing; if it begins to say that
    all things are aspects of universal purity and
    peace, and so on, why, then I shall not only be
    annoyed, but also bored. If a great man like
    the late Sir William Crookes says a table went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
    walking upstairs, I am impressed by the news;
    but not by news from nowhere to the effect that
    all men are perpetually walking upstairs, up a
    spiritual staircase, which seems to be as
    mechanical and labour-saving as a moving
    staircase at Charing Cross. Moreover, even
    a benevolent spirit might conceivably throw
    the furniture about merely for fun; whereas
    I doubt if anything but a devil from hell would
    say that all things are aspects of purity and
    peace.</p>
  <p>But I am here taking from the Spiritualistic
    articles a text that has nothing to do with
    Spiritualism. In a recent contribution to
    <i>Nash’s Magazine</i>, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
    remarks very truly that the modern world is
    weary and wicked and in need of a religion;
    and he gives examples of its more typical and
    terrible corruptions. It is perhaps natural
    that he should revert to the case of the Congo,
    and talk of it in the torrid fashion which recalls
    the days when Morel and Casement had some
    credit in English politics. We have since had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
    an opportunity of judging the real attitude of
    a man like Morel in the plainest case of black
    and white injustice that the world has ever
    seen. It was at once a replica and a reversal of
    the position expressed in the Pious Editor’s
    Creed, and might roughly be rendered in
    similar language.

  <p>He had of course a lurid denunciation of the
    late King Leopold, of which I will only say
    that, uttered by a Belgian about the Belgian
    king in his own land and lifetime, it would be
    highly courageous and largely correct; but
    that the parallel test is how much truth was told
    by British journalists about British kings in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
    their own land and lifetime; and that until we
    can pass that test, such denunciations do us
    very little good. But what interests me in the
    matter at the moment is this. Sir Arthur feels
    it right to say something about British corruptions,
    and passes from the Congo to Putumayo,
    touching a little more lightly; for even the
    most honest Britons have an unconscious trick
    of touching more lightly on the case of British
    capitalists. He says that our capitalists were
    not guilty of direct cruelty, but of an attitude
    careless and even callous. But what strikes
    me is that Sir Arthur, with his taste for such
    protests and inquiries, need not have wandered
    quite so far from his own home as the forests
    of South America.</p>
  <p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is an Irishman;
    and in his own country, within my own memory,
    there occurred a staggering and almost incredible
    crime, or series of crimes, which were
    worthier than anything in the world of the
    attention of Sherlock Holmes in fiction, or
    Conan Doyle in reality. It always will be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
    tribute to the author of <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> that he
    did, about the same time, do such good work
    in reality. He made an admirable plea for
    Adolf Beck and Oscar Slater; he was also
    connected, I remember, with the reversal of a
    miscarriage of justice in a case of cattle-mutilation.
    And all this, while altogether to
    his credit, makes it seem all the more strange
    that his talents could not be used for, and in,
    his own home and native country, in a mystery
    that had the dimensions of a monstrosity, and
    which did involve, if I remember right, a
    question of cattle-maiming. Anyhow, it was
    concerned with moonlighters and the charges
    made against them, such as the common one
    of cutting off the tails of cows. I can imagine
    Sherlock Holmes on such a quest, keen-eyed
    and relentless, finding the cloven hoof of some
    sinister and suspected cow. I can imagine
    Dr Watson, like the cow’s tail, always behind.
    I can imagine Sherlock Holmes remarking, in
    a light allusive fashion, that he himself had
    written a little monograph on the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
    cows’ tails; with diagrams and tables solving
    the great traditional problem of how many
    cows’ tails would reach the moon; a subject
    of extraordinary interest to moonlighters. And
    I can still more easily imagine him saying afterwards,
    having resumed the pipe and dressing-gown
    of Baker Street, ‘A remarkable little
    problem, Watson. In some of its features it
    was perhaps more singular than any you have
    been good enough to report. I do not think
    that even the Tooting Trouser-Stretching
    Mystery, or the singular little affair of the
    Radium Toothpick, offered more strange and
    sensational developments.’ For if the celebrated
    pair had really tracked out the Irish
    crime I have in mind, they would have found
    a story which, considered merely as a detective
    story, is by far the most dramatic and dreadful
    of modern times. Like nearly all such sensational
    stories, it traced the crime to somebody
    far higher in station and responsibility than
    any of those suspected. Like many of the most
    sensational of them, it actually traced the crime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
    to the detective who was investigating it. For
    if they had really crawled about with a magnifying
    glass, studying the supposed footprints of
    the peasants incriminated, they would have
    found they were made by the boots of the
    policeman. And the boots of a policeman, one
    feels, are things that even Watson might
    recognise.</p>
  <p>I have told the astounding story of Sergeant
    Sheridan before; and I shall often tell it again.
    Hardly any English people know it; and I
    shall go on telling it in the hope that all English
    people may know it some day. It ought to be
    first in every collection of <i>causes célèbres</i>, in every
    book about criminals, in every book of historical
    mysteries; and on its merits it would be. It
    is not in any of them. It is not there because
    there is a motive, in all modern British plutocracy,
    against finding the big British miscarriages
    of justice where they are really to be
    found; and that is a great deal nearer than
    Putumayo. It is a place far more appropriate
    to the exploits of the family of the Doyles. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
    is called Ireland; and in that place a powerful
    British official named Sheridan had been highly
    successful in the imperial service by convicting
    a series of poor Irishmen of agrarian crimes.
    It was afterwards discovered that the British
    official had carefully committed every one of
    the crimes himself; and then, with equal
    foresight, perjured himself to imprison
    innocent men. Any one who does not know
    the story will naturally ask what punishment
    was held adequate for such a Neronian
    monster; I will tell him. He was bowed out
    of the country like a distinguished stranger,
    his expenses politely paid, as if he had
    been delivering a series of instructive lectures;
    and he is now probably smoking a cigar in an
    American hotel, and much more comfortable
    than any poor policeman who has done his
    duty. I defy anybody to deny him a place in
    our literature about great criminals. Charles
    Peace escaped many times before conviction;
    Sheridan escaped altogether after conviction.
    Jack the Ripper was safe because he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
    undiscovered; Sheridan was discovered and was
    still safe. But I only repeat the matter here
    for two reasons. First, we may call our rule in
    Ireland what we like; we may call it the union
    when there is no union; we may call it Protestant
    ascendancy when we are no longer Protestants;
    or Teutonic lordship when we could only
    be ashamed of being Teutons. But this is
    what it <i>is</i>, and everything else is waste of words.
    And second, because an Irish investigator of
    cattle-maiming, so oblivious of the Irish cow,
    is in some danger of figuring as an Irish bull.</p>
  <p>Anyhow, that is the real and remarkable
    story of Sergeant Sheridan, and I put it first
    because it is the most practical test of the
    practical question of whether Ireland is misgoverned.
    It is strictly a fair test; for it is a
    test by the minimum and an argument <i>a
      fortiori</i>. A British official in Ireland can run
    a career of crime, punishing innocent people
    for his own felonies, and when he is found out,
    he is found to be above the law. This may
    seem like putting things at the worst, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
    really putting them at the best. This story was
    not told us on the word of a wild Irish Fenian,
    or even a responsible Irish Nationalist. It was
    told, word for word as I have told it, by the
    Unionist Minister in charge of the matter and
    reporting it, with regret and shame, to Parliament.
    He was not one of the worst Irish Secretaries,
    who might be responsible for the worst
    <i>régime</i>; on the contrary, he was by far the best.
    If even he could only partially restrain or reveal
    such things, there can be no deduction in
    common sense except that in the ordinary way
    such things go on gaily in the dark, with
    nobody to reveal and nobody to restrain them.
    It was not something done in those dark days
    of torture and terrorism, which happened in
    Ireland a hundred years ago, and which
    Englishmen talk of as having happened a
    million years ago. It was something that
    happened quite recently, in my own mature
    manhood, about the time that the better things
    like the Land Acts were already before the
    world. I remember writing to the <i>Westminster</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
    <i>Gazette</i> to emphasise it when it occurred; but
    it seems to have passed out of memory in an
    almost half-witted fashion. But that peep-hole
    into hell has afforded me ever since a
    horrible amusement, when I hear the Irish
    softly rebuked for remembering old unhappy
    far-off things and wrongs done in the Dark
    Ages. Thus I was especially amused to find
    the Rev. R. J. Campbell saying that ‘Ireland
    has been petted and coddled more than any
    other part of the British Isles’; because Mr
    Campbell was chiefly famous for a comfortable
    creed himself, for saying that evil is only ‘a
    shadow where light should be’; and there is
    no doubt here of his throwing a very black
    shadow where light is very much required.
    I will conceive the policeman at the corner of
    the street in which Mr Campbell resides as in
    the habit of killing a crossing-sweeper every
    now and then for his private entertainment,
    burgling the houses of Mr Campbell’s neighbours,
    cutting off the tails of their carriage
    horses, and otherwise disporting himself by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
    moonlight like a fairy. It is his custom to visit
    the consequences of each of these crimes upon
    the Rev. R. J. Campbell, whom he arrests at
    intervals, successfully convicts by perjury, and
    proceeds to coddle in penal servitude. But I
    have another reason for mentioning Mr Campbell,
    a gentleman whom I heartily respect in
    many other aspects; and the reason is connected
    with his name, as it occurs in another connection
    on another page. It shows how in anything,
    but especially in anything coming from
    Ireland, the old facts of family and faith outweigh
    a million modern philosophies. The
    words in <i>Who’s Who</i>—‘Ulster Protestant of
    Scottish ancestry’—give the really Irish and
    the really honourable reason for Mr Campbell’s
    extraordinary remark. A man may
    preach for years, with radiant universalism,
    that many waters cannot quench love; but
    Boyne Water can. Mr Campbell appears very
    promptly with what Kettle called ‘a bucketful
    of Boyne, to put the sunrise out.’ I will not
    take the opportunity of saying, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
    Ulsterman, that there never was treason yet but
    a Campbell was at the bottom of it. But I will
    say that there never was Modernism yet but
    a Calvinist was at the bottom of it. The old
    theology is much livelier than the New
    Theology.
  </p>
  <p>Many other such true tales could be told;
    but what we need here is a sort of test. This
    tale is a test; because it is the best that could
    be said, about the best that could be done, by
    the best Englishman ruling Ireland, in face of
    the English system established there; and it
    is the best, or at any rate the most, that we can
    know about that system. Another truth which
    might also serve as a test, is this; to note among
    the responsible English not only their testimony
    against each other, but their testimony
    against themselves. I mean the consideration
    of how very rapidly we realise that our own
    conduct in Ireland has been infamous, not in
    the remote past, but in the very recent past.
    I have lived just long enough to see the wheel
    come full circle inside one generation; when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
    I was a schoolboy, the sort of Kensington middle
    class to which I belong was nearly solidly
    resisting, not only the first Home Rule Bill,
    but any suggestion that the Land League had
    a leg to stand on, or that the landlords need do
    anything but get their rents or kick out their
    tenants. The whole Unionist Press, which was
    three-quarters of the Press, simply supported
    Clanricarde, and charged any one who did not
    do so with supporting the Clan-na-Gael. Mr
    Balfour was simply admired for enforcing the
    system, which it is his real apologia to have
    tried to end, or at least to have allowed Wyndham
    to end. I am not yet far gone in senile
    decay; but already I have lived to hear my
    countrymen talk about their own blind policy
    in the time of the Land League, exactly as they
    talked before of their blind policy in the time
    of the Limerick Treaty. The shadow on our
    past, shifts forward as we advance into the
    future; and always seems to end just behind us.
    I was told in my youth that the age-long misgovernment
    of Ireland lasted down to about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
    1870; it is now agreed among all intelligent
    people that it lasted at least down to about
    1890. A little common sense, after a hint like
    the Sheridan case, will lead one to suspect the
    simple explanation that it is going on still.</p>
  <p>Now I heard scores of such stories as the
    Sheridan story in Ireland, many of which I
    mention elsewhere; but I do not mention
    them here because they cannot be publicly
    tested; and that for a very simple reason. We
    must accept all the advantages and disadvantages
    of a rule of absolute and iron militarism.
    We cannot impose silence and then sift stories;
    we cannot forbid argument and then ask for
    proof; we cannot destroy rights and then discover
    wrongs. I say this quite impartially in
    the matter of militarism itself. I am far from
    certain that soldiers are worse rulers than
    lawyers and merchants; and I am quite certain
    that a nation has a right to give abnormal power
    to its soldiers in time of war. I only say that
    a soldier, if he is a sensible soldier, will know
    what he is doing and therefore what he cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
    do; that he cannot gag a man and then cross-examine
    him, any more than he can blow out
    his brains and then convince his intelligence.
    There may be; humanly speaking, there must
    be, a mass of injustices in the militaristic
    government of Ireland. The militarism itself
    may be the least of them; but it must involve
    the concealment of all the rest.</p>
  <p>It has been remarked above that establishing
    militarism is a thing which a nation had a right
    to do, and (what is not at all the same thing)
    which it may be right in doing. But with that
    very phrase ‘a nation,’ we collide of course
    with the whole real question; the alleged
    abstract wrong about which the Irish talk much
    more than about their concrete wrongs. I have
    put first the matters mentioned above, because
    I wish to make clear, as a matter of common
    sense, the impression of any reasonable outsider
    that they certainly have concrete wrongs.
    But even those who doubt it, and say that the
    Irish have no concrete grievance but only a
    sentiment of Nationalism, fall into a final and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
    very serious error about the nature of the thing
    called Nationalism, and even the meaning of
    the word ‘concrete.’ For the truth is that, in
    dealing with a nation, the grievance which is
    most abstract of all is also the one which is
    most concrete of all.</p>
  <p>Not only is patriotism a part of practical
    politics, but it is more practical than any
    politics. To neglect it, and ask only for
    grievances, is like counting the clouds and
    forgetting the climate. To neglect it, and
    think only of laws, is like seeing the
    landmarks and never seeing the landscape.
    It will be found that the denial of nationality
    is much more of a daily nuisance than the denial
    of votes or the denial of juries. Nationality is
    the most practical thing, because so many
    things are national without being political, or
    without being legal. A man in a conquered
    country feels it when he goes to market or even
    goes to church, which may be more often than
    he goes to law; and the harvest is more general
    than the General Election. Altering the flag<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
    on the roof is like altering the sun in the sky;
    the very chimney-pots and lamp-posts look
    different. Nay, after a certain interval of
    occupation they are different. As a man would
    know he was in a land of strangers before he
    knew it was a land of savages, so he knows
    a rule is alien long before he knows it is
    oppressive. It is not necessary for it to
    add injury to insult.</p>
  <p>For instance, when I first walked about
    Dublin, I was disposed to smile at the names
    of the streets being inscribed in Irish as
    well as English. I will not here discuss the
    question of what is called the Irish language,
    the only arguable case against which is that it
    is not the Irish language. But at any rate it is
    not the English language, and I have come to
    appreciate more imaginatively the importance
    of that fact. It may be used rather as a weapon
    than a tool; but it is a national weapon if it is
    not a national tool. I see the significance of
    having something which the eye commonly
    encounters, as it does a chimney-pot or a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
    lamp-post; but which is like a chimney reared
    above an Irish hearth or a lamp to light an Irish
    road. I see the point of having a solid object in
    the street to remind an Irishman that he is in
    Ireland, as a red pillar-box reminds an Englishman
    that he is in England. But there must be
    a thousand things as practical as pillar-boxes
    which remind an Irishman that, if he is in his
    country, it is not yet a free country; everything
    connected with the principal seat of government
    reminds him of it perpetually. It may
    not be easy for an Englishman to imagine how
    many of such daily details there are. But there
    is, after all, one very simple effort of the fancy,
    which would fix the fact for him for ever. He
    has only to imagine that the Germans have
    conquered London.</p>
  <p>A brilliant writer who has earned the name
    of a Pacifist, and even a Pro-German, once
    propounded to me his highly personal and even
    perverse type of internationalism by saying, as
    a sort of unanswerable challenge, ‘Wouldn’t
    you rather be ruled by Goethe than by Walter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
    Long?’ I replied that words could not express
    the wild love and loyalty I should feel for Mr
    Walter Long, if the only alternative were
    Goethe. I could not have put my own national
    case in a clearer or more compact form. I
    might occasionally feel inclined to kill Mr
    Long; but under the approaching shadow of
    Goethe, I should feel more inclined to kill
    myself. That is the deathly element in denationalisation;
    that it poisons life itself, the
    most real of all realities. But perhaps the best
    way of putting the point conversationally is to
    say that Goethe would certainly put up a monument
    to Shakespeare. I would sooner die than
    walk past it every day of my life. And in the
    other case of the street inscriptions, it is well
    to remember that these things, which we also
    walk past every day, are exactly the sort of
    things that always have, in a nameless fashion,
    the national note. If the Germans conquered
    London, they would not need to massacre me
    or even enslave me in order to annoy me; it
    would be quite enough that their notices were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
    in a German style, if not in a German language.
    Suppose I looked up in an English railway
    carriage and saw these words written in
    English exactly as I have seen them in a German
    railway carriage written in German: ‘The out-leaning
    of the body from the window of the
    carriage is because of the therewith bound up
    life’s danger strictly prohibited.’ It is not rude.
    It would certainly be impossible to complain
    that it is curt. I should not be annoyed by its
    brutality and brevity; but on the contrary by
    its elaborateness and even its laxity. But if it
    does not exactly shine in lucidity, it gives a
    reason; which after all is a very reasonable
    thing to do. By every cosmopolitan test, it is
    more polite than the sentence I have read in
    my childhood: ‘Wait until the train stops.’
    This is curt; this might be called rude; but
    it never annoyed me in the least. The nearest
    I can get to defining my sentiment is to say
    that I can sympathise with the Englishman
    who wrote the English notice. Having a rude
    thing to write, he wrote it as quickly as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
    could, and went home to his tea; or preferably
    to his beer. But what is too much for me, an
    overpowering vision, is the thought of that
    German calmly sitting down to compose that
    sentence like a sort of essay. It is the thought
    of him serenely waving away the one important
    word till the very end of the sentence, like the
    Day of Judgment to the end of the world. It
    is perhaps the mere thought that he did not
    break down in the middle of it, but endured
    to the end; or that he could afterwards calmly
    review it, and see that sentence go marching
    by, like the whole German army. In short,
    I do not object to it because it is dictatorial
    or despotic or bureaucratic or anything of
    the kind, but simply because it is German.
    Because it is German I do not object to it in
    Germany. Because it is German I should
    violently revolt against it in England. I do not
    revolt against the command to wait until the
    train stops, not because it is less rude, but
    because it is the kind of rudeness I can understand.
    The official may be treating me casually,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
    but at least he is not treating himself seriously.
    And so, in return, I can treat him and his notice
    not seriously but casually. I can neglect to
    wait until the train stops, and fall down on the
    platform, as I did on the platform of Wolverhampton,
    to the permanent damage of that fine
    structure. I can, by a stroke of satiric genius,
    truly national and traditional, the dexterous
    elimination of a single letter, alter the maxim
    to ‘Wait until the rain stops.’ It is a jest as
    profoundly English as the weather to which
    it refers. Nobody would be tempted to take
    such a liberty with the German sentence; not
    only because he would be instantly imprisoned
    in a fortress, but because he would not know
    at which end to begin.</p>
  <p>Now this is the truth which is expressed,
    though perhaps very imperfectly, in things
    like the Gaelic lettering on streets in Dublin.
    It will be wholesome for us who are English
    to realise that there is almost certainly an
    English way of putting things, even the most
    harmless things, which appears to an Irishman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
    quite as ungainly, unnatural, and ludicrous as
    that German sentence appears to me. As the
    famous Frenchman did not know when he was
    talking prose, the official Englishman does not
    know when he is talking English. He unconsciously
    assumes that he is talking Esperanto.
    Imperialism is not an insanity of patriotism;
    it is merely an illusion of cosmopolitanism.</p>
  <p>For the national note of the Irish language
    is not peculiar to what used to be called the
    Erse language. The whole nation used the
    tongue common to both nations with a difference
    far beyond a dialect. It is not a difference
    of accent, but a difference of style; which is
    generally a difference of soul. The emphasis,
    the elision, the short cuts and sharp endings of
    speech, show a variety which may be almost
    unnoticeable but is none the less untranslatable.
    It may be only a little more weight on a word,
    or an inversion allowable in English but abounding
    in Irish; but we can no more copy it than
    copy the compactness of the French <i>on</i> or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
    Latin ablative absolute. The commonest case
    of what I mean, for instance, is the locution that
    lingers in my mind with an agreeable phrase
    from one of Mr Yeats’s stories: ‘Whom I
    shall yet see upon the hob of hell, and them
    screeching.’ It is an idiom that gives the effect
    of a pointed postscript, a parting kick or sting
    in the tail of the sentence, which is unfathomably
    national. It is noteworthy and even
    curious that quite a crowd of Irishmen, who
    quoted to me with just admiration the noble
    ending of <i>Kathleen-na-Hulahan</i>, where the newcomer
    is asked if he has seen the old woman who
    is the tragic type of Ireland going out, quoted
    his answer in that form, ‘I did not. But I saw
    a young woman, and she walking like a queen.’
    I say it is curious, because I have since been
    told that in the actual book (which I cannot
    lay my hand on at the moment) a more classic
    English idiom is used. It would generally be
    most unwise to alter the diction of such a master
    of style as Mr Yeats: though indeed it is possible
    that he altered it himself, as he has sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
    done, and not always, I think, for the better.
    But whether this form came from himself or
    from his countrymen, it was very redolent of
    his country. And there was something inspiring
    in thus seeing, as it were before one’s
    eyes, literature becoming legend. But a hundred
    other examples could be given, even from
    my own short experience, of such fine turns of
    language, nor are the finest necessarily to be
    found in literature. It is perfectly true, though
    prigs may overwork and snobs underrate the
    truth, that in a country like this the peasants
    can talk like poets. When I was on the wild
    coast of Donegal, an old unhappy woman who
    had starved through the famines and the evictions,
    was telling a lady the tales of those times,
    and she mentioned quite naturally one that
    might have come straight out of times so mystical
    that we should call them mythical, that
    some travellers had met a poor wandering
    woman with a baby in those great gray rocky
    wastes, and asked her who she was. And she
    answered, ‘I am the Mother of God, and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
    is Himself, and He is the boy you will all be
    wanting at the last.’</p>
  <p>There is more in that story than can be put
    into any book, even on a matter in which its
    meaning plays so deep a part, and it seems
    almost profane to analyse it however sympathetically.
    But if any one wishes to know what
    I mean by the untranslatable truth which makes
    a language national, it will be worth while to
    look at the mere diction of that speech, and
    note how its whole effect turns on certain
    phrases and customs which happen to be
    peculiar to the nation. It is well known that
    in Ireland the husband or head of the house
    is always called ‘himself’; nor is it peculiar
    to the peasantry, but adopted, if partly in jest,
    by the gentry. A distinguished Dublin
    publicist, a landlord and leader among the
    more national aristocracy, always called me
    ‘himself’ when he was talking to my wife. It
    will be noted how a sort of shadow of that
    common meaning mingles with the more
    shining significance of its position in a sentence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
    where it is also strictly logical, in the sense of
    theological. All literary style, especially national
    style, is made up of such coincidences, which
    are a spiritual sort of puns. That is why
    style is untranslatable; because it is possible
    to render the meaning, but not the double
    meaning. There is even a faint differentiation
    in the half-humorous possibilities of the word
    ‘boy’; another wholly national nuance. Say
    instead, ‘And He is the child,’ and it is something
    perhaps stiffer, and certainly quite
    different. Take away, ‘This is Himself’ and
    simply substitute ‘This is He,’ and it is a
    piece of pedantry ten thousand miles from the
    original. But above all it has lost its note of
    something national, because it has lost its note
    of something domestic. All roads in Ireland,
    of fact or folk-lore, of theology or grammar,
    lead us back to that door and hearth of the
    household, that fortress of the family which is
    the key-fortress of the whole strategy of the
    island. The Irish Catholics, like other Christians,
    admit a mystery in the Holy Trinity, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
    they may almost be said to admit an experience
    in the Holy Family. Their historical experience,
    alas, has made it seem to them not
    unnatural that the Holy Family should be a
    homeless family. They also have found that
    there was no room for them at the inn, or anywhere
    but in the jail; they also have dragged
    their new-born babes out of their cradles, and
    trailed in despair along the road to Egypt, or
    at least along the road to exile. They also have
    heard, in the dark and the distance behind them,
    the noise of the horsemen of Herod.</p>
  <p>Now it is this sensation of stemming a stream,
    of ten thousand things all pouring one way,
    labels, titles, monuments, metaphors, modes
    of address, assumptions in controversy, that
    make an Englishman in Ireland know that he
    is in a strange land. Nor is he merely bewildered,
    as among a medley of strange things.
    On the contrary, if he has any sense, he soon
    finds them unified and simplified to a single
    impression, as if he were talking to a strange
    person. He cannot define it, because nobody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
    can define a person, and nobody can define
    a nation. He can only see it, smell it, hear it,
    handle it, bump into it, fall over it, kill it, be
    killed for it, or be damned for doing it wrong.
    He must be content with these mere hints of
    its existence; but he cannot define it, because
    it is like a person, and no book of logic will
    undertake to define Aunt Jane or Uncle
    William. We can only say, with more or less
    mournful conviction, that if Aunt Jane is not
    a person, there is no such thing as a person.
    And I say with equal conviction that if Ireland
    is not a nation, there is no such thing as a
    nation. France is not a nation, England is not
    a nation; there is no such thing as patriotism
    on this planet. Any Englishman, of any
    party, with any proposal, may well clear his
    mind of cant about that preliminary question.
    If we free Ireland, we must free it to be a
    nation; if we go on repressing Ireland, we are
    repressing a nation; if we are right to repress
    Ireland, we are right to repress a nation. After
    that we may consider what can be done,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
    according to our opinions about the respect due
    to patriotism, the reality of cosmopolitan and
    imperial alternatives, and so on. I will debate
    with the man who does not want mankind
    divided into nations at all; I can imagine a case
    for the man who wants specially to restrain one
    particular nation, as I would restrain anti-national
    Prussia. But I will not argue with a
    man about whether Ireland is a nation, or
    about the yet more awful question of whether
    it is an island. I know there is a sceptical
    philosophy which suggests that all ultimate
    ideas are only penultimate ideas, and therefore
    perhaps that all islands are really peninsulas.
    But I will claim to know what I mean
    by an island and what I mean by an individual;
    and when I think suddenly of my experience in
    the island in question, the impression is a
    single one; the voices mingle in a human voice
    which I should know if I heard it again, calling
    in the distance; the crowds dwindle into a
    single figure whom I have seen long ago upon
    a strange hill-side, and she walking like a queen.</p>

  </div>
  <p><span class="smcap">Of</span> that cloud of dream which seems to drift
    over so many Irish poems and impressions, I
    felt very little in Ireland. There is a real meaning
    in this suggestion of a mystic sleep, but
    it does not mean what most of us imagine, and
    is not to be found where we expect it. On the
    contrary, I think the most vivid impression
    the nation left on me, was that it was almost
    unnaturally wide awake. I might almost say
    that Ireland suffers from insomnia. This is
    not only literally true, of those tremendous
    talks, the prolonged activities of rich and restless
    intellects, that can burn up the nights from
    darkness to daybreak. It is true on the doubtful
    as well as the delightful side, and the
    temperament has something of the morbid
    vigilance and even of the irritability of insomnia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
    Its lucidity is not only superhuman, but it is
    sometimes in the true sense inhuman. Its
    intellectual clarity cannot resist the temptation
    to intellectual cruelty. If I had to sum up in
    a sentence the one fault really to be found with
    the Irish, I could do it simply enough. I should
    say it saddened me that I liked them all so
    much better than they liked each other. But
    it is our supreme stupidity that this is always
    taken as meaning that Ireland is a sort of
    Donnybrook Fair. It is really quite the reverse
    of a merely rowdy and irresponsible quarrel.
    So far from fighting with shillelaghs, they
    fight far too much with rapiers; their temptation
    is in the very nicety and even delicacy of
    the thrust. Of course there are multitudes
    who make no such deadly use of the national
    irony; but it is sufficiently common for even
    these to suffer from it; and after a time I
    began to understand a little that burden about
    bitterness of speech, which recurs so often
    in the songs of Mr Yeats and other Irish
    poets.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">Though hope fall from you and love decay</div>
      <div class="verse">Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But there is nothing dreamy about the bitterness;
    the worst part of it is the fact that the
    criticisms always have a very lucid and logical
    touch of truth. It is not for us to lecture the
    Irish about forgiveness, who have given them
    so much to forgive. But if some one who had
    not lost the right to preach to them, if St Patrick
    were to return to preach, he would find
    that nothing had failed, through all those ages
    of agony, of faith and honour and endurance;
    but I think he might possibly say, what I have
    no right to say, a word about charity.</p>
  <p>There is indeed one decisive sense in which
    the Irish are very poetical; in that of giving
    a special and serious social recognition to
    poetry. I have sometimes expressed the fancy
    that men in the Golden Age might spontaneously
    talk in verse; and it is really true that
    half the Irish talk is in verse. Quotation
    becomes recitation. But it is much too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
    rhythmic to resemble our own theatrical
    recitations. This is one of my own strongest
    and most sympathetic memories, and one of
    my most definable reasons for having felt extraordinarily
    happy in Dublin. It was a paradise
    of poets, in which a man who may feel inclined
    to mention a book or two of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, or
    illustrate his meaning with the complete ballad
    of the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, feels he will be better
    understood than elsewhere. But the more this
    very national quality is noted, the less it will be
    mistaken for anything merely irresponsible, or
    even merely emotional. The shortest way of
    stating the truth is to say that poetry plays the
    part of music. It is in every sense of the phrase
    a social function. A poetical evening is as
    natural as a musical evening, and being as
    natural it becomes what is called artificial. As
    in some circles ‘Do you play?’ is rather
    ‘Don’t you play?’ these Irish circles would be
    surprised because a man did not recite rather
    than because he did. A hostile critic, especially
    an Irish critic, might possibly say that the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
    are poetical because they are not sufficiently
    musical. I can imagine Mr Bernard Shaw
    saying something of the sort. But it might
    well be retorted that they are not merely
    musical because they will not consent to be
    merely emotional. It is far truer to say that
    they give a reasonable place to poetry, than that
    they permit any particular poetic interference
    with reason. ‘But I, whose virtues are the
    definitions of the analytical mind,’ says Mr
    Yeats, and any one who has been in the
    atmosphere will know what he means. In so
    far as such things stray from reason, they tend
    rather to ritual than to riot. Poetry is in
    Ireland what humour is in America; it is an
    institution. The Englishman, who is always
    for good and evil the amateur, takes both in a
    more occasional and even accidental fashion.
    It must always be remembered here that the
    ancient Irish civilisation had a high order of
    poetry, which was not merely mystical, but
    rather mathematical. Like Celtic ornament,
    Celtic verse tended too much to geometrical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
    patterns. If this was irrational, it was not by
    excess of emotion. It might rather be described
    as irrational by excess of reason. The antique
    hierarchy of minstrels, each grade with its own
    complicated metre, suggests that there was
    something Chinese about a thing so inhumanly
    civilised. Yet all this vanished etiquette is
    somehow in the air in Ireland; and men and
    women move to it, as to the steps of a lost
    dance.</p>
  <p>Thus, whether we consider the sense in
    which the Irish are really quarrelsome, or the
    sense in which they are really poetical, we find
    that both lead us back to a condition of clarity
    which seems the very reverse of a mere dream.
    In both cases Ireland is critical, and even
    self-critical. The bitterness I have ventured
    to lament is not Irish bitterness against the
    English; that I should assume as not only
    inevitable, but substantially justifiable. It is
    Irish bitterness against the Irish; the remarks
    of one honest Nationalist about another honest
    Nationalist. Similarly, while they are fond of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
    poetry, they are not always fond of poets, and
    there is plenty of satire in their conversation on
    the subject. I have said that half the talk may
    consist of poetry; I might almost say that the
    other half may consist of parody. All these
    things amount to an excess of vigilance and
    realism; the mass of the people watch and pray,
    but even those who never pray never cease to
    watch. If they idealise sleep, it is as the sleepless
    do; it might almost be said that they can
    only dream of dreaming. If a dream haunts
    them, it is rather as something that escapes
    them; and indeed some of their finest poetry
    is rather about seeking fairyland than about
    finding it. Granted all this, I may say that
    there was one place in Ireland where I did
    seem to find it, and not merely to seek it.
    There was one spot where I seemed to see the
    dream itself in possession, as one might see
    from afar a cloud resting on a single hill.
    There a dream, at once a desire and a delusion,
    brooded above a whole city. That place was
    Belfast.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>The description could be justified even
    literally and in detail. A man told me in
    north-east Ulster that he had heard a mother
    warning her children away from some pond,
    or similar place of danger, by saying, ‘Don’t
    you go there; there are wee popes there.’ A
    country where that could be said is like Elfland
    as compared to England. If not exactly a
    land of fairies, it is at least a land of goblins.
    There is something charming in the fancy of
    a pool full of these peculiar elves, like so many
    efts, each with his tiny triple crown or crossed
    keys complete. That is the difference between
    this manufacturing district and an English
    manufacturing district, like that of Manchester.
    There are numbers of sturdy Nonconformists
    in Manchester, and doubtless they direct some
    of their educational warnings against the
    system represented by the Archbishop of
    Canterbury. But nobody in Manchester, however
    Nonconformist, tells even a child that a
    puddle is a sort of breeding place for Archbishops
    of Canterbury, little goblins in gaiters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
    and aprons. It may be said that it is a very
    stagnant pool that breeds that sort of efts.
    But whatever view we take of it, it remains
    true, to begin with, that the paradox could be
    proved merely from superficial things like
    superstitions. Protestant Ulster reeks of superstition;
    it is the strong smell that really comes
    like a blast out of Belfast, as distinct from
    Birmingham or Brixton. But to me there is
    always something human and almost humanising
    about superstition; and I really think
    that such lingering legends about the Pope,
    as a being as distant and dehumanised as the
    King of the Cannibal Islands, have served as
    a sort of negative folk-lore. And the same may
    be said, in so far as it is true that the commercial
    province has retained a theology as well as
    a mythology. Wherever men are still theological
    there is still some chance of their being
    logical. And in this the Calvinist Ulsterman
    may be more of a Catholic Irishman than is
    commonly realised, especially by himself.</p>
  <p>Attacks and apologies abound about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
    matter of Belfast bigotry; but bigotry is by no
    means the worst thing in Belfast. I rather
    think it is the best. Nor is it the strongest
    example of what I mean, when I say that
    Belfast does really live in a dream. The other
    and more remarkable fault of the society has
    indeed a religious root; for nearly everything
    in history has a religious root, and especially
    nearly everything in Irish history. Of that
    theoretical origin in theology I may say something
    in a moment; it will be enough to say
    here that what has produced the more prominent
    and practical evil is ultimately the theology
    itself, but not the habit of being theological.
    It is the creed, but not the faith. In so far
    as the Ulster Protestant really has a faith, he
    is really a fine fellow; though perhaps not
    quite so fine a fellow as he thinks himself.
    And that is the chasm; and can be most
    shortly stated as I have often stated it in such
    debates: by saying that the Protestant generally
    says, ‘I am a good Protestant,’ while the
    Catholic always says, ‘I am a bad Catholic.’</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>When I say that Belfast is dominated by a
    dream, I mean it in the strict psychological
    sense; that something inside the mind is
    stronger than everything outside it. Nonsense
    is not only stronger than sense, but stronger
    than the senses. The idea in a man’s head can
    eclipse the eyes in his head. Very worthy and
    kindly merchants told me there was no poverty
    in Belfast. They did not say there was less
    poverty than was commonly alleged, or less
    poverty than there had been, or less than there
    was in similar places elsewhere. They said
    there was none. As a remark about the
    Earthly Paradise or the New Jerusalem, it
    would be arresting. As a remark about the
    streets, through which they and I had both
    passed a few moments before, it was simply
    a triumph of the sheer madness of the imagination
    of man. These eminent citizens of Belfast
    received me in the kindest and most courteous
    fashion, and I would not willingly say anything
    in criticism of them beyond what is necessary
    for the practical needs of their country and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
    mine. But indeed I think the greatest criticism
    on them, is that they would not understand
    what the criticism means. I will therefore
    clothe it in a parable, which is none the worse
    for having also been a real incident. When
    told there was no poverty in Belfast, I had
    remarked mildly that the people must have a
    singular taste in dress. I was gravely assured
    that they had indeed a most singular taste in
    dress. I was left with the general impression
    that wearing shirts or trousers decorated with
    large holes at irregular intervals was a pardonable
    form of foppery or fashionable extravagance.
    And it will always be a deep indwelling
    delight, in the memories of my life, that just
    as these city fathers and I came out on to the
    steps of the hotel, there appeared before us one
    of the raggedest of the ragged little boys I had
    seen, asking for a penny. I gave him a penny,
    whereon this group of merchants was suddenly
    transfigured into a sort of mob, vociferating,
    ‘Against the law! Against the law!’ and
    bundled him away. I hope it is not unamiable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
    to be so much entertained by that vision of a
    mob of magistrates, so earnestly shooing away
    a solitary child like a cat. Anyhow, they knew
    not what they did; and, what is worse, knew
    not that they knew not. And they would not
    understand, if I told them, what legend might
    have been made about that child, in the
    Christian ages of the world.</p>
  <p>The point is here that the evil in the delusion
    does not consist in bigotry, but in vanity. It
    is not that such a Belfast man thinks he is
    right; for any honest man has a right to think
    he is right. It is that he does think he is good,
    not to say great; and no honest man can reach
    that comfortable conviction without a course
    of intellectual dishonesty. What cuts this
    spirit off from Christian common sense is the
    fact that the delusion, like most insane delusions,
    is merely egotistical. It is simply the pleasure
    of thinking extravagantly well of oneself, and
    unlimited indulgence in that pleasure is far
    more weakening than any indulgence in drink
    or dissipation. But so completely does it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
    construct an unreal cosmos round the ego, that
    the criticism of the world cannot be felt even
    for worldly purposes. I could give many
    examples of this element in Belfast, as compared
    even with Birmingham or Manchester. The
    Lord Mayor of Manchester may not happen to
    know much about pictures, but he knows men
    who know about them. But the Belfast
    authorities will exhibit a maniacally bad picture
    as a masterpiece, merely because it glorifies
    Belfast. No man dare put up such a picture
    in Manchester, within a stone’s-throw of Mr
    Charles Rowley. I care comparatively little
    about the case of æsthetics; but the case is even
    clearer in ethics. So wholly are these people
    sundered from more Christian traditions that
    their very boasts lower them; and they abase
    themselves when they mean to exalt themselves.
    It never occurs to them that their
    strange inside standards do not always impress
    outsiders. A great employer introduced me to
    several of his very intelligent employees, and
    I can readily bear witness to the sincerity of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
    great Belfast delusion even among many of the
    poorer men of Belfast. But the sincere efforts
    of them and their master, to convince me that
    a union with the Catholic majority under Home
    Rule was intolerable to them, all went to one
    tune, which recurred with a kind of chorus,
    ‘We won’t have the likes of them making laws
    for the likes of us.’ It never seemed to cross
    their minds that this is not a high example of
    any human morality; that judged by pagan
    <i>verecundia</i> or Christian humility or modern
    democratic brotherhood, it is simply the remark
    of a snob. The man in question is quite
    innocent of all this; he has no notion of
    modesty, or even of mock modesty. He is not
    only superior, but he thinks it a superiority
    to claim superiority.

  <p>It is here that we cannot avoid theology,
    because we cannot avoid theory. For the
    point is that even in theory the one religious
    atmosphere now differs from the other. That
    the difference had historically a religious root
    is really unquestionable; but anyhow it is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
    deeply rooted. The essence of Calvinism was
    certainty about salvation; the essence of
    Catholicism is uncertainty about salvation.
    The modern and materialised form of that
    certainty is superiority; the belief of a man in
    a fixed moral aristocracy of men like himself.
    But the truth concerned here is that, by this
    time at any rate, the superiority has become
    a doctrine as well as an indulgence. I doubt if
    this extreme school of Protestants believe in
    Christian humility even as an ideal. I doubt
    whether the more honest of them would even
    profess to believe in it. This can be clearly seen
    by comparing it with other Christian virtues,
    of which this decayed Calvinism offers at least
    a version, even to those who think it a perversion.
    Puritanism is a version of purity; if
    we think it a parody of purity. Philanthropy
    is a version of charity; if we think it a parody
    of charity. But in all this commercial Protestantism
    there is no version of humility; there is
    not even a parody of humility. Humility is not
    an ideal. Humility is not even a hypocrisy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
    There is no institution, no commandment, no
    common form of words, no popular pattern or
    traditional tale, to tell anybody in any fashion
    that there is any such thing as a peril of
    spiritual pride. In short, there is here a school
    of thought and sentiment that does definitely
    regard self-satisfaction as a strength, as against
    the strong Christian tradition in the rest of the
    country that does as definitely regard it as a
    weakness. That is the real moral issue in the
    modern struggle in Ireland, nor is it confined
    to Ireland. England has been deeply infected
    with this pharisaical weakness, but as I have
    said, England takes things vaguely where
    Ireland takes them vividly. The men of
    Belfast offer that city as something supreme,
    unique and unrivalled; and they are very
    nearly right. There is nothing exactly like it
    in the industrialism of this country; but for
    all that, the fight against its religion of arrogance
    has been fought out elsewhere and on a
    larger field. There is another centre and
    citadel from which this theory, of strength in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
    a self-hypnotised superiority, has despised
    Christendom. There has been a rival city to
    Belfast; and its name was Berlin.</p>
  <p>Historians of all religions and no religion
    may yet come to regard it as an historical fact,
    I fancy, that the Protestant Reformation of the
    sixteenth century (at least in the form it
    actually took) was a barbaric breakdown, like
    that Prussianism which was the ultimate product
    of that Protestantism. But however this
    may be, historians will always be interested to
    note that it produced certain curious and
    characteristic things, which are worth studying
    whether we like or dislike them. And one of its
    features, I fancy, has been this; that it has had
    the power of producing certain institutions
    which progressed very rapidly to great wealth
    and power; which the world regarded at a
    certain moment as invincible; and which the
    world, at the next moment, suddenly discovered
    to be intolerable. It was so with the whole of
    that Calvinist theology, of which Belfast is now
    left as the lonely missionary. It was so, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
    in our own time, with the whole of that industrial
    capitalism of which Belfast is now the besieged
    and almost deserted outpost. And it was so
    with Berlin as it was with Belfast; and a subtle
    Prussian might almost complain of a kind of
    treachery, in the abruptness with which the
    world woke up and found it wanting; in the
    suddenness of the reaction that struck it
    impotent, so soon after it had been counted on
    omnipotent. These things seem to hold all the
    future, and in one flash they are things of the
    past.</p>
  <p>Belfast is an antiquated novelty. Such a
    thing is still being excused for seeming <i>parvenu</i>
    when it is discovered to be <i>passé</i>. For instance,
    it is only by coming in touch with some of the
    controversies surrounding the Convention, that
    an Englishman could realise how much the
    mentality of the Belfast leader is not so much
    that of a remote seventeenth century Whig, as
    that of a recent nineteenth century Radical.
    His conventionality seemed to be that of a
    Victorian rather than a Williamite, and to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
    less limited by the Orange Brotherhood than
    by the Cobden Club. This is a fact most
    successfully painted and pasted over by the
    big brushes of our own Party System, which
    has the art of hiding so many glaring facts.
    This Unionist Party in Ireland is very largely
    concerned to resist the main reform advocated
    by the Unionist Party in England. A political
    humorist, who understood the Cobden tradition
    of Belfast and the Chamberlain tradition
    of Birmingham, could have a huge amount of
    fun appealing from one to the other; congratulating
    Belfast on the bold Protectionist
    doctrines prevalent in Ireland; adjuring Mr
    Bonar Law and the Tariff Reformers never to
    forget the fight made by Belfast for the sacred
    principles of Free Trade. But the fact that the
    Belfast school is merely the Manchester school
    is only one aspect of this general truth about
    the abrupt collapse into antiquity: a sudden
    superannuation. The whole march of that
    Manchester industrialism is not only halted
    but turned; the whole position is outflanked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
    by new forces coming from new directions;
    the wealth of the peasantries blocks the road
    in front of it; the general strike has risen
    menacing its rear. That strange cloud of self-protecting
    vanity may still permit Belfast to
    believe in Belfast, but Britain does not really
    believe in Belfast. Philosophical forces far
    wider and deeper than politics have undermined
    the conception of progressive Protestantism
    in Ireland. I should say myself that mere
    English ascendancy in that island became
    intellectually impossible on the day when
    Shaftesbury introduced the first Factory Act,
    and on the day when Newman published the
    first pages of the <i>Apologia</i>. Both men were
    certainly Tories and probably Unionists.
    Neither were connected with the subject or
    with each other; the one hated the Pope and
    the other the Liberator. But industrialism was
    never again self-evidently superior after the
    first event, or Protestantism self-evidently
    superior after the second. And it needed a
    towering and self-evident superiority to excuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
    the English rule in Ireland. It is only on the
    ground of unquestionably doing good that
    men can do so much evil as that.</p>
  <p>Some Orangemen before the war indulged
    in a fine rhetorical comparison between William
    of Prussia and William of Orange, and openly
    suggested that the new Protestant Deliverer
    from the north would come from North
    Germany. I was assured by my more moderate
    hosts in Belfast that such Orangemen could not
    be regarded as representative or even responsible.
    On that I cannot pronounce. The
    Orangemen may not have been representative;
    they may not have been responsible; but I am
    quite sure they were right. I am quite sure
    those poor fanatics were far nearer the nerve of
    historical truth than professional politicians like
    Sir Edward Carson or industrial capitalists like
    Sir George Clark. If ever there was a natural
    alliance in the world, it would have been the
    alliance between Belfast and Berlin. The
    fanatics may be fools, but they have here the
    light by which the foolish things can confound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
    the wise. It is the brightest spot in Belfast,
    bigotry, for if the light in its body be darkness,
    it is still brighter than the darkness. By the
    vision that goes everywhere with the virility
    and greatness of religion, these men had indeed
    pierced to the Protestant secret and the meaning
    of four hundred years. Their Protestantism is
    Prussianism, not as a term of abuse, but as a
    term of abstract and impartial ethical science.
    Belfast and Berlin are on the same side in the
    deepest of all the spiritual issues involved in
    the war. And that is the simple issue of whether
    pride is a sin, and therefore a weakness. Modern
    mentality, or great masses of it, has seriously
    advanced the view that it is a weakness to
    disarm criticism by self-criticism, and a strength
    to disdain criticism through self-confidence.
    That is the thesis for which Berlin gave battle
    to the older civilisation in Europe; and that
    for which Belfast gave battle to the older
    civilisation in Ireland. It may be, as I suggested
    that such Protestant pride is the old Calvinism,
    with its fixed election of the few. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
    that the Protestantism is merely Paganism, with
    its brutish gods and giants lingering in corners
    of the more savage north. It may be that the
    Calvinism was itself a recurrence of the
    Paganism. But in any case, I am sure that
    this superiority, which can master men like a
    nightmare, can also vanish like a nightmare.
    And I strongly suspect that in this matter also,
    as in the matter of property as viewed by a
    peasantry, the older civilisation will prove to
    be the real civilisation, and that a healthier
    society will return to regarding pride as a
    pestilence, as the Socialists have already returned
    to regarding avarice as a pestilence. The old
    tradition of Christendom was that the highest
    form of faith was a doubt. It was the doubt
    of a man about his soul. It was admirably
    expressed to me by Mr Yeats, who is no
    champion of Catholic orthodoxy, in stating his
    preference for mediæval Catholicism as compared
    with modern humanitarianism: ‘Men
    were thinking then about their own sins, and
    now they are always thinking about other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
    peoples.’ And even by the Protestant test of
    progress, pride is seen to be arrested by a
    premature paralysis. Progress is superiority
    to oneself, and it is stopped dead by superiority
    to others. The case is even clearer by the test
    of poetry, which is much more solid and
    permanent than progress. The Superman may
    have been a sort of poem, but he could never
    be any sort of poet. The more we attempt to
    analyse that strange element of wonder, which
    is the soul of all the arts, the more we shall see
    that it must depend on some subordination of
    the self to a glory existing beyond it, and even
    in spite of it. Man always feels as a creature
    when he acts as a creator. When he carves a
    cathedral, it is to make a monster that can
    swallow him. But the Nietzschean nightmare
    of swallowing the world is only a sort of
    yawning. When the evolutionary anarch has
    broken all links and laws and is at last free to
    speak, he finds he has nothing to say. So
    German songs under the imperial eagle fell
    silent like songbirds under a hawk; and it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
    but rarely, and here and there, that a Belfast
    merchant liberates his soul in a lyric. He has
    to get Mr Kipling to write a Belfast poem, in
    a style technically attuned to the Belfast pictures.
    There is the true Tara of the silent harp, and
    the throne and habitation of the dream; and it
    is there that the Celtic pessimists should weep
    in silence for the end of song. Blowing one’s
    own trumpet has not proved a good musical
    education.</p>
  <p>In logic a wise man will always put the cart
    before the horse. That is to say, he will always
    put the end before the means; when he is
    considering the question as a whole. He does
    not construct a cart in order to exercise a horse.
    He employs a horse to draw a cart, and whatever
    is in the cart. In all modern reasoning
    there is a tendency to make the mere political
    beast of burden more important than the chariot
    of man it is meant to draw. This has led to
    a dismissal of all such spiritual questions in
    favour of what are called social questions; and
    this to a too facile treatment of things like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
    religious question in Belfast. There is a
    religious question; and it will not have an
    irreligious answer. It will not be met by the
    limitation of Christian faith, but rather by the
    extension of Christian charity. But if a man
    says that there is no difference between a
    Protestant and a Catholic, and that both can
    act in an identical fashion everywhere but in
    a church or chapel, he is madly driving the
    cart-horse when he has forgotten the cart.
    A religion is not the church a man goes to but
    the cosmos he lives in; and if any sceptic
    forgets it, the maddest fanatic beating an
    Orange drum about the Battle of the Boyne
    is a better philosopher than he.</p>
  <p>Many uneducated and some educated people
    in Belfast quite sincerely believe that Roman
    priests are fiends, only waiting to rekindle the
    fires of the Inquisition. For two simple
    reasons, however, I declined to take this fact
    as evidence of anything except their sincerity.
    First, because the stories, when reduced to their
    rudiment of truth, generally resolved themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
    into the riddle of poor Roman Catholics
    giving money to their own religion, and seemed
    to deplore not so much a dependence on priests
    as an independence of employers. And second,
    for a reason drawn from my own experience, as
    well as common knowledge, concerning the
    Protestant gentry in the south of Ireland. The
    southern Unionists spoke quite without this
    special horror of Catholic priests or peasants.
    They grumbled at them or laughed at them as
    a man grumbles or laughs at his neighbours;
    but obviously they no more dreamed that the
    priest would burn them than that he would eat
    them. If the priests were as black as the black
    Protestants painted them, they would be at
    their worst where they are with the majority,
    and would be known at their worst by the
    minority. It was clear that Belfast held the
    more bigoted tradition, not because it knew
    more of priests, but because it knew less of
    them; not because it was on the spot, but
    because the spot was barred. An even more
    general delusion was the idea that all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
    southern Irish dreamed and did no work. I
    pointed out that this also was inconsistent with
    concrete experience; since all over the world
    a man who makes a small farm pay has to work
    very hard indeed. In historic fact, the old
    notion that the Irish peasant did no work, but
    only dreamed, had a simple explanation. It
    merely meant that he did no work for a
    capitalist’s profit, but dreamed of some day
    doing work for his own profit. But there may
    also have been this distorted truth in the
    tradition; that a free peasant, while he extends
    his own work, creates his own holidays. He
    is not idle all day, but he may be idle at any
    time of the day; he does not dream whenever
    he feels inclined, but he does dream whenever
    he chooses. A famous Belfast manufacturer,
    a man of capacity, but one who shook his head
    over the unaccountable prevalence of priests,
    assured me that he had seen peasants in the
    south doing nothing, at all sorts of odd times;
    and this is doubtless the difference between
    the farm and the factory. The same gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
    showed me over the colossal shipping of
    the great harbour, with all machinery and
    transport leading up to it. No man of any
    imagination would be insensible to such titanic
    experiments of his race; or deny the dark
    poetry of those furnaces fit for Vulcan or those
    hammers worthy of Thor. But as I stood on
    the dock I said to my guide: ‘Have you ever
    asked what all this is for?’ He was an
    intelligent man, an exile from metaphysical
    Scotland, and he knew what I meant. ‘I don’t
    know,’ he said, ‘perhaps we are only insects
    building a coral reef. I don’t know what is
    the good of the coral reef.’ ‘Perhaps,’ I said,
    ‘that is what the peasant dreams about, and
    why he listens to the priest.’</p>
  <p>For there seems to be a fashionable fallacy,
    to the effect that religious equality is something
    to be done and done with, that we may go on
    to the real matter of political equality. In
    philosophy it is the flat contrary that is true.
    Political equality is something to be done and
    done with, that we may go on to the much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
    more real matter of religion. At the Abbey
    Theatre I saw a forcible play by Mr St John
    Irvine, called <i>The Mixed Marriage</i>, which I
    should remember if it were only for the beautiful
    acting of Miss Maire O’Neill. But the
    play moved me very much as a play; yet I felt
    that the presence of this fallacy falsified it in
    some measure. The dramatist seemed to resent
    a schism merely because it interfered with a
    strike. But the only object of striking is
    liberty; and the only object of liberty is life:
    a thing wholly spiritual. It is economic liberty
    that should be dismissed as these people dismiss
    theology. We only get it to forget it. It is
    right that men should have houses, right that
    they should have land, right that they should
    have laws to protect the land; but all these
    things are only machinery to make leisure for
    the labouring soul. The house is only a stage
    set up by stage carpenters for the acting of
    what Mr J. B. Yeats has called ‘the drama of
    the home.’ All the most dramatic things
    happen at home, from being born to being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
    dead. What a man thinks about these things
    is his life; and to substitute for them a bustle
    of electioneering and legislation is to wander
    about among screens and pulleys on the wrong
    side of pasteboard scenery, and never to act
    the play. And that play is always a miracle
    play; and the name of its hero is Everyman.</p>
  <p>When I came back from the desolate
    splendour of the Donegal sea and shore, and
    saw again the square garden and the statue
    outside the Dublin hotel, I did not know I was
    returning to something that might well be
    called more desolate. For it was when I
    entered the hotel that I first found that it was
    full of the awful tragedy of the <i>Leinster</i>. I had
    often seen death in a home, but never death
    decimating a vast hostelry; and there was
    something strangely shocking about the empty
    seats of men and women with whom I had
    talked so idly a few days before. It was almost
    as if there was more tragedy in the cutting
    short of such trivial talk than in the sundering
    of life-long ties. But there was all the dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
    as well as the tragedy of man; and I was glad,
    before I left Ireland, to have seen the nobler
    side of the Anglo-Irish garrison, and to have
    known men of my own blood, however mistaken,
    so enduring the end of things. With the bad
    news from the sea came better news from the
    war; the Teutonic hordes were yielding everywhere,
    at the signal of the last advance;
    and with all the emotions of an exile,
    however temporary, I knew that my own land
    was secure. Somehow, the bad and good
    news together turned my mind more and more
    towards England; and all the inner humour
    and insular geniality which even the Irish may
    some day be allowed to understand. As I went
    homewards on the next boat that started from
    the Irish port, and the Wicklow hills receded
    in a rainy and broken sunlight, it was with all
    the simplest of those ancient appetites with
    which a man should come back to his own
    country. Only there clung to me, not to be
    denied, one sentiment about Ireland, one
    sentiment that I could not transfer to England;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
    which called me like an elfland of so many
    happy figures, from Puck to Pickwick. As I
    looked at those rainy hills I knew at least that
    I was looking, perhaps for the last time, on
    something rooted in the Christian faith. There
    at least the Christian ideal was something more
    than an ideal; it was in a special sense real.
    It was so real that it appeared even in statistics.
    It was so self-evident as to be seen even by
    sociologists. It was a land where our religion
    had made even its vision visible. It had made
    even its unpopular virtues popular. It must
    be, in the times to come, a final testing-place,
    of whether a people that will take that name
    seriously, and even solidly, is fated to suffer or
    to succeed.</p>
  <p>As the long line of the mountain coast
    unfolded before me I had an optical illusion;
    it may be that many have had it before. As
    new lengths of coast and lines of heights were
    unfolded, I had the fancy that the whole land
    was not receding but advancing, like something
    spreading out its arms to the world. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
    chance shred of sunshine rested, like a riven
    banner, on the hill which I believe is called in
    Irish the Mountain of the Golden Spears; and
    I could have imagined that the spears and the
    banner were coming on. And in that flash
    I remembered that the men of this island had
    once gone forth, not with the torches of conquerors
    or destroyers, but as missionaries in
    the very midnight of the Dark Ages; like a
    multitude of moving candles, that were the
    light of the world.</p>

    <p>MRS HUMPHRY WARD</p>
    <p>Author of <i>The War and Elizabeth</i>, <i>Missing</i>, etc.</p>
    <p><i>Cousin Philip</i> is chiefly a study of the change which
      the war has brought about, on the modern girl and the
      relations of men and women. Helena, an orphan girl of
      great beauty and some wealth, has consented, to please
      her dying mother, to spend two years, from her 19th to
      her 21st birthday under the care of her guardian, Lord
      Buntingford, rather than go at once, as she herself wishes,
      to a University, in preparation for an independent life.
      She is headstrong, wilful, and clever; as keen intellectually
      as she is fond of dancing and flirting. Mrs Humphry
      Ward shows all her well-known skill in the handling of
      the subsequent situation, that skill which has made her
      books models of the novel writer’s art. Lord Buntingford’s
      modern yet chivalrous character, with his poetic
      personality, make him a charming figure. The <i>dénouement</i>
      is unexpected.</p>

    <p>FRANCIS BRETT YOUNG</p>
    <p>Author of <i>Marching on Tanga</i>, etc.</p>
    <p><i>The Young Physician</i> is the history of the formative
      years of a boy who, after leaving one of our public
      schools, decides more from force of circumstances than
      from inclination to enter the medical profession. Side-light
      is thrown upon our educational system in the
      first part of the book, which is devoted to home and
      school life; while in the second, the impressions and
      experiences which went to the moulding of his character
      are presented side by side with a picture of student life
      at the Midland Hospital where he pursues his medical
      curriculum. The success of such a book lies no less in
      its truth to life than in its ability to entertain the reader,
      both of which conditions are fulfilled in Major Brett
      Young’s new novel where, once again, the author breaks
      entirely new ground.</p>

    <p>By H. H. BASHFORD</p>
    <p><i>The Plain Girl’s Tale</i>, by H. H. Bashford, is the longest novel
      that the author of <i>The Corner of Harley Street</i> has yet written, and
      the first that he has produced since the publication of <i>Pity the Poor
        Blind</i>, six years ago. Though dealing with the adventures and development
      of a girl of the artisan class in various spheres of contemporary life,
      it stands apart from the war and is in no sense merely topical. In the
      delineation of the central character, through whose eyes most of the action
      of the novel is seen, the author has endeavoured to expand the ethical
      theme that was the basis of his previous novel.</p>

    <p>By MARY AGNES HAMILTON</p>
    <p>Author of ‘<i>Dead Yesterday</i>,’ etc.</p>
    <p>Placed first in Scotland and later in London, and timed more than a
      dozen years before the war, this story follows the intertwined fortunes of
      a brother and sister, members of a singularly happy, artistically-sensitive,
      and romantically-minded family, into whose tranquillity there crashes a
      queer, brilliantly gifted realist. Contact with him indeed colours, whether
      they will or no, the lives of all the people who meet him, even after his
      mysterious disappearance; and especially that of the girl whom, judged by
      ordinary standards, he treats so ill. Happiness has a hundred faces, and
      that which she learns to see will set readers questioning.</p>

    <p>By J. MILLS WHITHAM</p>
    <p>Author of ‘<i>Fruit of Earth</i>.’</p>
    <p>In his new novel, Mr Mills Whitham, while developing his realistic
      art, leaves sombre tragedy for picaresque comedy. The tale carries the
      girl Zillah through early years in a North Devon hamlet, adventures on
      Exmoor, the roads, and at the West Country Fairs, excitements in London,
      and leaves her back again at the hamlet, ripe in her own wisdom. Peasants,
      show-folk, gipsies, nimble vagabonds, philosophers and fools, make their
      bow and enliven the Circus.</p>

    <p>A Novel of the plenteous days before the war. The author has
      essayed the high imaginative task of investing the established order with the
      mantle of romance. It is not the mantle of Don Quixote nor of Tartarin
      de Tarascon: but it is the best and gayest cloak of humour which the
      author could devise consistently with the sentiments of awe and reverence
      with which he naturally approached the subject.</p>

      1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
      effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

      Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
    </div>
    <div>
      Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
      electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
      computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
      exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
      from people in all walks of life.
    </div>
    <div>
      Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
      assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
      goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
      remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
      Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
      and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
      generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
      Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

      Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation
    </div>
    <div>
      Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
      public support and donations to carry out its mission of
      increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
      freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
      array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
      ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
      status with the IRS.
    </div>
    <div>
      The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
      charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
      States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
      considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
      with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
      where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
      DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
      visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
    </div>
    <div>
      While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
      have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
      against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
      approach us with offers to donate.
    </div>
    <div>
      International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
      any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
      outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
    </div>
    <div>
      Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
      methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
      ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
      donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

      Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
    </div>
    <div>
      Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
      Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
      freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
      distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
      volunteer support.
    </div>
    <div>
      Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
      editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
      the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
      necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
      edition.
    </div>
    <div>
      Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
      facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
    </div>
    <div>
      This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
      including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
      subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
